# Name registry

Every proper noun in the story has a **stable id** here. Nick isn't sold on
the names yet (gate 1, 2026-09-28: "I hope you set them all as variables in
some way"), so **the ids are what's fixed; the display names can change at
any time.**

## How renaming works

- **Game scripts and data never write a registered name literally.** They use
  the id: speaker ids in `.dlg` files are the character ids below, and names
  inside text are name tokens resolved from the game's names table (format
  and token syntax: `assets/dialogue/README.md`, "Names"). Renaming in the
  game = one line in that table, `assets/data/names.ron` (it holds every id
  below; a test keeps the two in step).
- **The story docs** (`bible.md`, `characters/`, `outline.md`, `chapters/`,
  `ledger.md`) use the display names so they stay readable. To rename: change
  the name in this file, then replace the old name across `docs/story/` in the
  same commit. Every name below is unique, so a whole-word find-and-replace is
  safe (check `Rue`, `Wren` and `Crane`, which are also ordinary
  English words, by eye).
- **A name's short forms are separate rows** (the "Short forms" table below:
  first names, family names, a god's name and title on their own), because
  people mostly say "Hollis", not "Hollis Marr". **Renaming a character means
  changing the full name and every short form of it** (rename Hollis Marr and
  `retainer`, `retainer.first` and, if the family name changes, `family.marr`
  and the other Marrs all change), here and in `names.ron`. Nothing derives
  one from the other, so a short form can also be a nickname that isn't part
  of the full name.
- **Character sheet files are named by id** (`characters/retainer.md`), not by
  name, so they never move.
- New names get an id here first.

## Short forms

What people say instead of the full name. Scripts use these ids like any
other (`{n:retainer.first}`); the validator rejects a short form written out

# Architecture Decision Records

Technical decisions live here. **Game-design** decisions (stats, magic, story)
are Nick's and live in [`docs/design/`](../design/README.md) instead.

An ADR is never edited to change its meaning after it is `Accepted`. To change a
decision, write a new ADR that supersedes it and set the old one's status to
`Superseded by ADR-NNNN`. Use the `write-adr` skill.

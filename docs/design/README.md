# Game design decisions

Nick decides how the game plays. Each `00xx` ticket asks him (using the
`ask-nick` skill: options from real games + "describe your own"), and records
the answer here as a concrete, implementable rule set. Implementation tickets
treat these files as the source of truth, and never invent answers that aren't
here.

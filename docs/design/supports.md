# Supports and relationships

Decided: 2026-09-25
Source: ticket 0010

## Nick's words

> **Q1. How are personal stories told?** "I do like the hub activities but I
> agree it can lead to bloat + dating sim vibes. So I think a mix of A and C
> can work. Fire Emblem newer entries also raise support between healer /
> buffer and others when the healer / buffer uses an ability on the other. We
> can take that idea too. Hub activities we can add much later when we've
> refined the core loop. It should be a ticket in the far future or maybe
> never implemented due to scope explosion."
>
> **How A (earned supports) and C (camp events) split the work:** "Supports
> everywhere, camp for extras"
>
> **Q2. Support limits:** "Unlimited"
>
> **Battle effect of a support:** "for now small flat bonus is OK but pair
> abilities might be added far in the future"
>
> **Review of the first draft** (same day): "I think the numbers you picked
> might be too easy to achieve. C is ok to reach early but A should really
> take a long time." / "for combining bonus we should just disallow that and
> take the highest bonus available" / "support conversations should be
> viewable after unlock when in a camp or hub or something"
>
> **On pacing:** "the chapters again... are typically not a single battle...
> I think chapters 1 and 2 and maybe 3 could be 1 battle but then it should
> be more open ended and there will be a lot of small skirmishes so keep this
> in mind with your claims"

> **Review of the rules as built** (2026-10-04, ticket 1002). On a battle
> won during the player phase giving no "adjacent at the end of the phase"
> point: "we can have it still give the bonus". On a pair starting with

Options he was shown: A = FE GBA / Path of Radiance supports, B = Three Houses
hub activities, C = Triangle Strategy / Unicorn Overlord camp events, D = main
script only.

## Summary

- **Earned supports (FE GBA style) carry the personal stories**, including
  the lead's bonds with companions. Pairs build points by fighting together,
  and by one healing or buffing the other (Nick, from newer FE games).
- **Camp events (Triangle Strategy style) are extras**: short, optional,
  scripted scenes at camp. They don't need grinding and have no
  mechanical effect.
- **Unlimited A-ranks** per unit.
- **C comes early, A takes a long time** (Nick).
- **Small flat Hit/Avoid bonus** from the **single best** supported partner
  nearby; bonuses never combine (Nick).
- Conversations are **viewed at camp** once unlocked (Nick).
- **Not now:** hub activities (far future, maybe never) and pair abilities
  (far future). Each is a parked ticket (see below).
- **No romance** (from `setting-and-tone.md`, 0007). Supports are friendship,
  rivalry, mentorship and family. There are no S ranks, no marriage and no
  shipping. A couple that already exists before the story starts may appear,
  but it is never developed into a romance on screen.

## Rules: earned supports

### Pairs

- A pair can build support only if it is **listed in the content data** with
  its conversations. Not every pair of units has a support (as in FE GBA).
  Which pairs exist, and what their conversations say, is decided by the
  story pipeline (`story-writing` skill, character sheets in 0701 and later
  content tickets), not here.
- **The lead has supports too**: lead ↔ companion pairs are normal pairs. In
  them the lead follows the Persona-style lead rules in `setting-and-tone.md`:
  few lines, and at most one reply choice per conversation (*tunable*). The
  reply changes a line or two of reaction, never the rank or the points.
- The same pair can't have two rank tracks. Support is symmetric: A↔B is one
  value.

### Ranks and thresholds

Ranks are **C → B → A**. Points are per pair and cumulative. Nick fixed the
shape (C early, A "should really take a long time"); the numbers are
*tunable*:

| Rank | Points needed |
| ---- | ------------- |
| C | 20 |
| B | 80 |
| A | 180 |

- Reaching a threshold **unlocks** that rank's conversation. The rank is
  **gained only when the conversation is viewed** (FE GBA).
- While a conversation is unlocked but not viewed, the pair's points stop at
  that threshold (extra points are lost). This stops a pair jumping two ranks.
- Because conversations are only viewed at camp, a pair gains **at most one
  rank per camp visit**, however many battles it fights in between.
- **Unlimited A-ranks** (Nick): a unit can reach A with every partner that it
  has a support with.
- **At rank A a pair keeps gaining points** (Nick). They do nothing for now:
  A is the highest rank and the bonus stays the A bonus. The count is kept in
  the save so that ranks past A could be added after launch without losing
  what pairs have earned. Whether such ranks ever exist is not decided here
  (see *Not in this system*).
- **Every pair starts at 0 points with every rank locked** (Nick: "all
  support ranks should be locked at beginning. no starting at C").
- A pair may give a thresholds override in data (e.g. a slow-burn rivalry
  needing more points, or close friends needing fewer). C always needs at
  least 1 point. Default is the table above.

### Gaining points (all *tunable*)

A pair gains points only when **both units are deployed and on the map**
(alive and not retreated). The events below are counted per pair.

| Event | Points |
| ----- | ------ |
| At the end of the player phase, the two units are **adjacent** (4 directions, like attack range 1). Winning the battle during the player phase counts as its end (Nick) | +1 |
| A unit **fights** (attacks or is attacked, any range) while its partner is adjacent to it | +3 |
| A unit **heals** its partner with a spell or skill (e.g. Heal, Sanctuary) | +3 |
| A unit **buffs** its partner with a skill (e.g. War Cry) | +3 |
| A unit **uses an item on** its adjacent partner (e.g. a potion, `weapons-and-items.md`) | +2 |

- A heal or buff that covers several allies (Sanctuary, War Cry) gives the
  points to each pair (caster, ally) it affects.
- Healing, buffing or using an item counts whenever the game allows the
  action. Nothing counts for an ally that isn't in a support pair with the
  caster.
- **Rough pace, counted in battles, not chapters.** A chapter is a story
  beat, not one battle (`chapter-1.md`). Chapters 1–2 (maybe 3) are a single
  battle each. After that the game opens up, with many small skirmishes
  between the bigger story battles. Estimates for a pair that fights side by
  side and ends most turns adjacent:

  | Battle kind | Points for the pair |
  | ----------- | ------------------- |
  | Full story battle (~10+ turns) | ~8–12 |
  | Small skirmish (a few turns) | ~2–5 |

  So **C comes after about 2 story battles** (or a handful of skirmishes).
  **A needs about 15–20 story battles' worth** of fighting side by side, or
  a lot of skirmishes on top of fewer story battles. A healer who heals the
  same ally often gets there somewhat faster.
- **Skirmishes let players push a favourite pair along** (like the optional
  fights in FE Sacred Stones). That's accepted: A still takes a long time,
  and the points per skirmish stay low because skirmishes are short. How many
  skirmishes a typical run has depends on the random-skirmish numbers in
  `world-structure.md` (0008: capped per act, tunable). Retune
  B and A once it's known, so A stays a late-game reward that a normal run
  can still reach. Playtests (0013 and later) may change every number here.
- Rewind (`death-and-difficulty.md`) rolls support points back like every
  other battle state change (they are ordinary events).

### Battle bonus

When a unit fights, it gets the bonus of its **best-ranked supported
partner within 3 tiles** (Manhattan distance, *tunable*) that is on the map:

| Partner's rank with this unit | Hit | Avoid |
| ----------------------------- | --- | ----- |
| C | +5 | +5 |
| B | +10 | +10 |
| A | +15 | +15 |

- **Bonuses never combine** (Nick). With several partners in range, only the
  highest rank counts (e.g. an A partner and a C partner nearby → +15/+15).
  So the most a unit can ever get is the A bonus, whatever its number of
  A-ranks.
- The bonus applies to attacking and to defending (counters).
- The forecast shows the bonus as part of the numbers, and the unit info
  screen lists the unit's supports and ranks. How it looks is up to the UI
  tickets.
- No other stat is affected. **Pair abilities** (Awakening-style dual attacks
  or dual guards) are a possible far-future addition, not part of this system.

### Death and retreat

- **Classic:** when a unit dies, its supports stop. Unlocked but unviewed
  conversations with it are removed. Viewed conversations stay in the
  "seen" list.
- **Casual:** a retreated unit comes back as `death-and-difficulty.md` says,
  and its supports carry on unchanged. It gains no points for the rest of the
  battle it retreated from.

### Viewing support conversations

Once unlocked, a support conversation can be viewed **at camp** (Nick:
"viewable after unlock when in a camp or hub or something"), never during a
battle. Camp is a screen **between battles**, not only between chapters.
Where it's offered (0008, [`world-structure.md`](world-structure.md)):
in the linear opening chapters, between chapters; from the world map on,
`Camp` in the **world map menu** whenever no battle is running (Nick: "A");
and before each story battle's Preparations. Camp holds a **Supports** list next to the camp events. If a hub
(1004) is ever built, the Supports list moves into it. The list shows each
unlocked conversation (pair and rank) and marks new ones. Conversations use
the normal two-portrait dialogue player (0702/0704).

## Rules: camp events

- Short, **scripted, optional** conversations that appear in a **Camp** list
  once the story reaches a set point (e.g. "after the story battle at the
  river fort, if Mira is alive").
- They need no points and give no points, stats or items. They're **extras**:
  flavour, banter, small world details, group scenes of 3+ characters that
  don't fit a pair.
- They may include the lead, with the same reply-choice rules as supports.
- Which camp events exist and when they appear is decided by the story
  pipeline, alongside each chapter's story.
- Personal arcs **must not** depend on camp events alone. The arc lives in the
  main script and the character's supports (Nick: "Supports everywhere, camp
  for extras").

## Not in this system

- **Hub activities** (Three Houses: walk a base, meals, gifts). Nick: far
  future, "or maybe never". Parked in ticket 1004.
- **Pair abilities** (dual attack/guard). Parked in ticket 1005.
- **Romance, S ranks, marriage, children.** Ruled out by 0007.

## Open sub-questions (deferred)

- **Endings:** does each unit get a solo epilogue line, and do A-rank pairs
  get a paired ending (FE GBA)? With unlimited A-ranks, paired endings need a
  rule (e.g. "the last A-rank viewed"). Ask Nick when the ending is written.
- **Support log / replay:** whether seen conversations can be re-read from a
  menu. Default: yes, in the Supports list (Claude's choice; not a design
  question unless Nick objects).
- The point values, thresholds and bonus numbers above are starting values,
  to be tuned after playtests.

## Implementation tickets

- **1002** Support points, ranks and battle bonus (core rules + data).
- **1003** Supports and camp lists at camp (UI + dialogue).
- **1004** Hub activities (parked, far future / maybe never).
- **1005** Pair abilities (parked, far future).

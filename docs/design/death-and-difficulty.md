# Death, rewind, difficulty and saving

Decided: 2026-09-25
Source: ticket 0006

## Nick's words

> **Q1. What happens when a unit falls?** "1D" (the player picks Classic or
> Casual at New Game).
>
> **Q2. Undo / rewind** "2A but charges can vary by our perceived difficulty of
> battle, and if you restart a battle it refunds the charges"
>
> **Q3. Difficulty modes** "3B to start, we should just tune for one difficulty
> to start and can add a hard or merciless difficulty later"
>
> **Q4. Saving** "4A" (FE: save between chapters + a suspend save mid-battle
> that's deleted on load).
>
> **Casual retreat, clarified in 0010** (2026-09-25): a chapter can hold
> several battles, so a retreated unit comes back "for next battle" (Nick:
> "yes back for next battle").

Follow-ups (Nick asked to decide every lever himself: "don't decide these game
design levers yourself. Let's go through them."):

> **Classic: a dead unit's gear** "1B" (it goes back to the stock).
>
> **Casual: cost of retreating** "A" (nothing beyond missing the rest of that
> battle).
>
> **Switching mode after New Game** "3A, and same with Hard->Normal if we
> implement hard mode in the future." (Classic → Casual only, one way.)
>
> **Charges per map** "4C but more tiers of map difficulty like 2 on easy maps,
> 3 on normal, 5 on hard, 8 on big and hard (i.e. finale)"
>
> **How far back a rewind goes** "5A" (any earlier action in the battle,
> enemy actions included).
>
> **Restarting** "6A" (from the map menu at any time).
>
> **Save slots** "7C" then "let's say 30 save slots"
>
> **Unused charges** "8C but rather than gold maybe a small level xp bonus to
> each surviving unit (not crazy, it shouldn't need to be expected to never use
> them, but just a way to reward good play)"
>
> **Size of that bonus** "Again I don't know about exact numbers. But I think
> probably something small, not enough to be meta-gamey. A or B, probably in
> between the two. C is overstepping" (A = 5 EXP per charge, B = 10, C = 20.)
>
> Then: "The one thing I want to adjust is that the 7 is more like a
> percentage of level up than a fixed number. If we decide to go dragon ball
> scaling maybe it takes 1M xp to lv up and each charge gives 70K. But for now
> until I get a feel for numbers in the display then we can go with grounded
> numbers i.e. 7"
>
> **Who gets the bonus** "11B" (every deployed unit, including Casual retreats).
>
> **Lord falls in Casual** "9A" (game over in both modes).

On 0801's starting rules (PR #127, 2026-09-30):

> "1. sure 2. it doesn't need a cap, I don't think it would ever exceed tbh
> and minor overflow to next lv is ok 3. sure [...] 7. Retry chapter would
> only be applicable for ch1 and 2 and maybe 3... rest chapters would be
> several battles... so of course it should be retry, maybe even retry
> battle"

(1: every unit is back at full HP for the next battle. 3: a unit that dies
in Classic sends its whole loadout to the stock.)

On retrying a battle that has Preparations (ticket 0408, 2026-10-01):

> **After a defeat (Retry Battle) or Restart Battle: where do you land?**
> "back on preparations, with another option to Rewind if charges are left"

On how a won battle shows its rewards (ticket 0810, 2026-10-01; rendered
mockups of A message boxes, B a results screen, C EXP bars on the map, D
one summary box):

> "1B
> 2A
> 3B"

(1B: one results screen with the gold, the rewinds left and every unit's
EXP bar. 2A: right after `VICTORY`, before the victory scenes. 3B: a press
only skips the bars' animation; each level-up screen still waits for its
own press.)

On 0802's starting rules (PR #141, 2026-10-01):

> "1. sure 2. make a confirmation screen for this 3. sure 4. sure 5. ok,
> will need to see this in action to comment on it but it's fine for now
> 6. no let's make it the first empty one and make sure it mentions if it
> will overwrite [...] 8. ok 9. ok [...] 10. yea sure"

(1: `Continue` on top of the title menu only while a battle is suspended,
`Load Game` under `New Game`. 2: `Suspend` asks first. 3: one suspended
battle at a time. 4: "Save your progress?" is `Yes` / `No`. 5: what a slot
shows. 6: where the slot list opens when saving.)

## Falling units

A unit falls when its HP reaches 0.

**Game mode**, picked on a screen right after `New Game`:

| Mode | What happens to a fallen player unit |
| ---- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Classic** | Dies. It plays its death quote (0705), leaves the map, and is removed from the roster when the battle's result is applied. Its equipped weapons and items go to the stock. |
| **Casual** | Retreats. It plays a retreat line (same trigger slot as a death quote), leaves the map, and is back in the roster at full HP for the **next battle** (story battle or skirmish; a chapter can hold several battles). It keeps all EXP and weapon progress earned before falling. No other cost. |

- Within a battle both modes behave the same: the fallen unit leaves the map,
  can't act, can't be targeted and doesn't block tiles. The difference only
  matters when the campaign applies the battle result.
- **Mode changes:** Classic → Casual is allowed at any time (options menu);
  Casual → Classic never. If harder difficulties are added later, the same
  one-way rule applies (e.g. Hard → Normal only).
- The mode is stored in the campaign, so it's part of every save.
- Enemy, ally and neutral units that fall are always removed; the mode only
  affects the player's own units.

**Loss conditions** (checked after every action and at every phase boundary,
per `turn-structure.md`), in **both** modes:

1. Any player unit marked as a **lord** falls → game over.
2. Every player unit on the map has fallen → game over.
3. A map's turn limit runs out (`turn-structure.md`).

Game over offers `Retry Battle` (restart the battle, not the chapter) or
`Title` (Nick, PR #127). It will also offer **`Rewind`** while rewind
charges are left (Nick, 0408), so a defeat can be undone without starting
over: ticket 0822.

**Between battles** (Nick, PR #127): every unit, standing or retreated, is
back at **full HP** for the next battle. A unit that dies in Classic sends
its **whole loadout** to the stock: weapons (keeping their wear), armour
and accessory.

## Rewind

Limited rewind, like Three Houses' Divine Pulse and Echoes' Turnwheel, plus the
standard FE "cancel your move before you choose an action".

- **Cancel before commit:** a moved unit can be put back freely until an action
  is chosen (`turn-structure.md`). Free and unlimited; it isn't a rewind.
- **Rewind charges per map**, by the map's difficulty tier (Nick):

  | Map tier | Charges |
  | -------- | ------- |
  | Easy | 2 |
  | Normal | 3 |
  | Hard | 5 |
  | Finale (big and hard) | 8 |

  Each chapter file names its tier; the game looks up the charge count.
- A rewind jumps back to **any earlier action** in the current battle, enemy
  actions included, and costs **1 charge** however far back it goes.
- Luck is part of the saved state: repeating the same actions after a rewind
  gives the same results. Doing something different changes the outcome.
- **Restart:** `Restart battle` in the map menu (with a confirm), available at
  any time, and `Retry Battle` on Game Over both put the battle back at its first turn
  and **refund every charge**. A battle with a Preparations screen goes
  back to **Preparations** first (Nick, 0408), with the loadouts and pack
  as the player left them.
- Rewind works the same in Classic and Casual.

### Unused charges

Charges don't carry over to the next map. Instead, each unused charge gives a
**small EXP bonus** when the battle is won:

- Every **deployed** player unit gets it: units still standing *and* units that
  retreated in Casual. (Classic-dead units are gone; undeployed units get
  nothing.)
- Size (Nick): small, "not enough to be meta-gamey", and defined as a
  **share of one level**, not a fixed number: **7% of the EXP needed for a
  level per unused charge**. With today's 100 EXP per level that is **7 EXP**;
  if the EXP scale grows (e.g. 1,000,000 per level) the bonus scales with it
  (70,000). The percentage may be revisited once Nick sees the numbers on
  screen (0804).
- The bonus is added after the battle's normal EXP as **one award with no
  100-EXP cap** (Nick, PR #127: "minor overflow to next lv is ok"); only the
  level cap limits it. At most 8 charges × 7 = 56 today.

### Results screen (Nick, 0810)

A won battle shows what it gave on **one results screen**, right after the
`VICTORY` banner and **before the victory scenes**:

- the gold for clearing the map, and the party's gold now;
- the rewind charges left, out of the map's (e.g. `3 of 3`), and the bonus
  EXP they give each unit;
- one row per deployed unit that gets the bonus (name, class, level and
  its EXP bar). All the bars fill at once, from the unit's EXP before the
  bonus; a unit that levels shows its new level and `LEVEL UP`.

Then, for each unit the bonus levelled, the usual level-up screen
(`progression.md`), one at a time.

**Skipping** (Nick): Confirm or Cancel fills the bars at once, and holding
Confirm fills them faster, as on the EXP bar after a combat. A press on
full bars goes on. **Each level-up screen still waits for its own press**;
nothing skips them all.

Example: Chapter 1 won with all 3 charges unused shows `+1000` gold,
`3 of 3` rewinds, `+21` bonus EXP, and six bars each moving 21 EXP; a unit
that was at 88 EXP ends at 9 with `LEVEL UP`, and its level-up screen comes
next.

*Claude's starting rules* (presentation; Nick may veto):

- With **no charge left** there is no bonus line and no unit rows: just the
  gold and `0 of 3`.
- A battle with **no clear gold** shows no gold line.
- A unit **at the level cap** is listed with its bar unchanged.
- The bars wait half a second, then fill over one second (*tunable*).
- The wording (`Gold for clearing the map`, `Rewinds unused`, `Bonus EXP
  for each unit`) is the mockup's.

## Difficulty

**One difficulty, tuned well.** There is no difficulty picker. Hard or Merciless
may be added later, with a new decision ticket; a downgrade then works like
Classic → Casual (one way only).

**Ironman** (Nick, 2026-10-05): a third mode at New Game beside Classic and
Casual, which hides everything that undoes a result, rewind included. The
details (what a defeat does, saving, switching mode) are open: ticket 0049,
[`replayability.md`](replayability.md).

## Saving

FE style: chapter saves plus a one-time suspend.

- **30 save slots** (Nick). After every chapter victory: "Save your progress?"
  (`Yes` / `No`; `No` goes on without saving), then a slot picker showing
  chapter title, mode, roster size and playtime.
  - The picker **opens on the first empty slot** (Nick, PR #141), so
    Confirm saves without replacing anything.
  - On a slot that already holds a save, the help line reads `overwrite`
    instead of `save here`, and choosing it asks "Overwrite slot 03?"
    first (Nick: "make sure it mentions if it will overwrite").
  - A slot shows the title of the chapter the save goes on with, the mode,
    "3 units" and the playtime as `1:02:05`; an empty one reads "Empty".
    (*Claude's starting look; Nick will comment once he has seen it.*)
- `Load Game` on the title screen starts the saved campaign at the beginning of
  its next chapter. It sits under `New Game`, greyed out until a slot has a
  save.
- **Suspend:** `Suspend` in the map menu asks "Suspend the battle and return
  to the title?" (Nick, PR #141: "make a confirmation screen for this"),
  then saves the whole battle (including rewind history and charges left) to
  a single suspend save and returns to the title. The title then shows
  `Continue`, on top and highlighted. Continuing **deletes** the suspend
  save, so it can't be reloaded to undo a turn.
  - There is one suspended battle at a time: suspending again replaces it.
    Starting a `New Game` or loading a slot leaves it there.
  - After `Continue` the cursor starts on the lead: the battle is saved,
    not where the player was looking.
- No other saving mid-battle.
- **World map (added by 0008, 2026-09-26):** once the game reaches the world
  map (after the linear opening chapters), the world map menu has `Save`
  whenever no battle is running (Nick: "A", Sacred Stones / Echoes style),
  using the same 30 slots. `Load Game` then restores the campaign on the world
  map at the saved node. Battles still only have the one-time `Suspend`. See
  [`world-structure.md`](world-structure.md).

## Open sub-questions (deferred)

- Whether 7% of a level per unused charge feels right: check at the Chapter 1
  playtest (0804).
- Harder difficulty modes: after Chapter 1.

# Tilesets (`.ron` + `.png`)

What a **sprite map skin** paints the battle map with (ADR-0038, ADR-0049):
a tile for every terrain and a picture for units, by the game's ids
(terrain, classes, characters). The rules never read a tileset; only the
look hangs off these ids. Loaded and checked by `trpg_content::tileset`
into `Content::tilesets`, by id.

The game starts with the tileset called **`tiny_tales`** when it has it.
That one is bought art: it exists only in the private assets
(`assets-private/game/tilesets/`, ADR-0040), so a build without them
starts with the glyph skin (coloured letters). The tilesets in this folder
are generated test fixtures, reachable from the debug menu (F2 → *Map
skin*, which goes round every tileset).

## Format

`assets/tilesets/<id>.ron`:

```ron
(
    id: "test",                      // the file's name, without .ron
    image: "tilesets/test.png",      // a PNG in the asset bundle, by its path under assets/
    tile_px: (24, 24),               // a map tile, across × down: in the image, and on screen in console pixels
    terrain: {                       // terrain id (terrain.ron) → (column, row) in tile_px steps from the image's top-left
        "plain": (0, 0), "road": (1, 0), "forest": (2, 0),
    },
    unit_px: (24, 24),               // a unit picture, across × down; may be taller than a tile
    units: (
        characters: {},              // character id (characters.ron) → a picture
        classes: { "brigand": (0, 1), "rider": (1, 1) },   // class id (classes.ron) → a picture
        fallback: (7, 4),            // the picture of a unit with neither
    ),
    units_origin_px: (0, 48),        // the pixel where the unit grid's (0, 0) starts (default (0, 0))
)
```

A unit **picture** is written one of two ways, and a file may mix them:

- `(column, row)`: a cell of the tileset's own `image`, in `unit_px` steps
  from `units_origin_px`;
- `(image: "units/fighter_male.png", frame: (1, 0))`: a frame of an image
  file of its own, in `unit_px` steps from that image's top-left.

**A walking sheet.** Add `walk: true` to a picture with an image of its
own, `(image: "units/fighter_male.png", frame: (1, 0), walk: true)`, to
say the image has the **3 × 4 layout**: 3 columns (walking frames: one
foot forward, standing, the other foot forward) × 4 rows (facing down,
left, right, up) of `unit_px` frames from its top-left. The bought map
sprites are like this: one 48×80 sheet per character or class, of 16×20
frames. Such a unit steps on the spot while it can still act, and turns
and moves its legs as it walks (ticket 0440); `frame` stays the standing,
front-facing frame, `(1, 0)`. A picture without `walk` (and every
`(column, row)` picture) is always drawn as it is: the unit only glides
from tile to tile.

**A tileset with no terrain tiles** leaves out `image`, `tile_px` and
`terrain` (keep `image` if a unit picture is a `(column, row)`). The
terrain, the ranges, the path and the cursor are then painted as glyphs,
on the glyph skin's 16×16 tiles, and only the units are pictures:

```ron
(
    id: "test_units",
    unit_px: (16, 20),
    units: (
        characters: { "lead_f": (image: "units/fighter_female.png", frame: (1, 0), walk: true) },
        classes: { "guard": (image: "tilesets/test_units/guard.png", frame: (1, 0), walk: true) },
        fallback: (image: "tilesets/test_units/fallback.png", frame: (1, 0), walk: true),
    ),
)
```

- A unit's picture is its **character's**, else its **class's**, else the
  **fallback**. The lead's goes by the gender the player picked first:
  `characters` may name `lead_m` and `lead_f` as well as `lead`.
- It is drawn at its own size, centred across its tile, its feet on top
  of the 2-pixel HP bar: a picture taller than a tile reaches into the
  tile above.
- What the art doesn't show, the skin draws itself, the same for every
  tileset (`docs/design/look-and-feel.md`, *Battle map: bought tiles and
  unit sprites*): a 1-pixel outline in the unit's side's colour, grey and
  darker once it has acted, the HP bar, and an up or down arrow
  (`assets/images/effect_marks.png`) while it is under a timed effect.

## Checks

The all-assets test (ADR-0005) reports every problem in every file, with
its name:

- the file must parse, with no unknown fields, and its `id` must be its
  name;
- `image` must be a PNG in the bundle, and so must every unit picture's
  own image; every rectangle (each terrain tile, each unit picture, the
  fallback) must lie inside its image;
- each side of `tile_px` and `unit_px` must be 8 to 64 px;
- an image with `walk: true` must be big enough for 3 × 4 frames of
  `unit_px`;
- `terrain` needs `tile_px` and `image`; `tile_px` without `terrain` is an
  error; a `(column, row)` picture needs `image`;
- with `terrain`, **every terrain in `terrain.ron` must have a tile**
  (`terrain "…" has no tile`); every terrain, class and character named
  must exist.

## Files

| File | What |
| ---- | ---- |
| `test.ron`, `test.png` | The **test tileset**: 24 × 24 tiles, so nothing can quietly assume the glyph skin's 16 × 16. Each terrain's tile is its `bg` colour with its two glyphs in its `fg` colour; each class's picture is a grey disc with the first two letters of its name in white, by class id; then a `??` fallback. Not art: generated from our own data and the font atlas |
| `test_units.ron`, `test_units/*.png` | The **test unit sheets**: no terrain tiles, and one 48×80 sheet per class of the Quick Battle (and a `??` fallback), shaped like the bought map sprites: 3 × 4 frames of 16 × 20, each a grey figure with the class's first two letters, a band across its head by facing and its feet by walking frame. Every entry has `walk: true`. Not art: generated the same way |

These files are **generated**; never edit them by hand. After changing the
terrain, the classes, the palette or the font, regenerate them:

```bash
cargo xtask test-tileset
```

A test in `xtask` fails if the committed files differ from what the tool
makes.

## Adding a tileset

1. Put the image and its `.ron` here (bought art goes in the private assets
   repository's `game/` instead, ADR-0040).
2. Give every terrain a tile, or none; give classes and characters pictures
   where the art has them.
3. Run the content tests: they name anything missing or outside the image.

The bought map sprites aren't added by hand: `cargo xtask
map-sprite-import` copies the ones the game uses into
`assets-private/game/units/` and writes `tilesets/tiny_tales.ron` from the
table in `crates/xtask/src/map_sprite_import.rs` (`--list` prints it).

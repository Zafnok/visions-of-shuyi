# 0432 — Battle map through a map scene and a map skin

## Context

Nick wants graphics to be replaceable (2026-10-01): if the battle map's
glyphs are swapped for sprites, that must be a small job. ADR-0038 sets the
rules. Today the map's look is written into the battle screen
(`crates/ui/src/screens/battle/mod.rs`): `draw_terrain`, `draw_ranges`,
`draw_units` and `draw_cursor_and_path` write glyph cells directly, and
"a tile is two 8×16 cells" is spread over `layout::TILE_W_CELLS`,
`layout::VIEW_TILES_W/H`, `camera::tile_to_cell`, `path::TILE_PX`,
`units::HP_BAR_W` and the cursor's pixel offsets (`cursor.rs`, ADR-0024).

This ticket puts a seam there and changes **no pixel**: the battle screen
builds a plain-data `MapScene` (what is on the visible map), and a `MapSkin`
paints it. The only skin is the glyph skin, which is today's drawing code,
moved. Ticket 0433 adds a second skin; 0434 moves tests onto the scene.

Numbering: 0430 is used by two open pull requests and 0431 will go to
whichever is renumbered, so this block continues at 0432.

## Nick input

None. Nothing a player sees changes.

## Scope

**In:**
- `MapScene`, `MapSkin`, `GlyphSkin` in a new `crates/ui/src/map_view/`
  module.
- The battle screen builds a scene and calls the skin for everything
  inside `MAP_VIEW`.
- Tile size and viewport size in tiles come from the skin.
- `Harness` access to the scene, and a text dump of it.

**Out (do not do):**
- Any change to how the map looks. Every existing snapshot must be
  byte-identical.
- A sprite skin, tileset files, a skin setting (0433).
- Rewriting existing tests to use the scene (0434).
- Panels, menus, the forecast, the combat box, dialogs: they stay cell
  drawing in the battle screen.
- Moving `Unit::map_label` out of `core` (ADR-0038 keeps it).

## Implementation steps

1. **Read ADR-0038** (sections 1, 3, 4).
2. **`crates/ui/src/map_view/scene.rs`**, plain data, `Clone + PartialEq +
   Debug`, no palette colours and no cell or pixel coordinates:
   ```rust
   pub struct MapScene {
       pub origin: Pos,               // map tile at the view's top-left (may be negative)
       pub size: (i32, i32),          // visible tiles, across × down
       pub tiles: Vec<TileView>,      // row-major, size.0 × size.1
       pub units: Vec<UnitView>,      // only units on visible tiles, in state order
       pub cursor: Option<CursorView>,
       pub path: Vec<Pos>,            // the selected unit's path, origin first; empty = none
   }
   pub struct TileView {
       pub terrain: Option<TerrainId>,   // None = off the map
       pub tints: Vec<RangeKind>,        // in the order they are laid on
   }
   pub enum RangeKind { Danger, Move, Attack, Heal }
   pub struct UnitView {
       pub id: UnitId,
       pub pos: Pos,                  // where it is drawn (mid-walk positions included)
       pub faction: Faction,
       pub label: String,             // core's map_label
       pub class: ClassId,
       pub character: Option<CharacterId>,
       pub acted: bool,
       pub hp: (StatValue, StatValue),   // current, max
       pub has_effect: bool,          // under a timed effect (0412)
       pub fade: f32,                 // 0 = solid … 1 = gone (falling, 0404)
   }
   pub struct CursorView { pub pos: Pos, pub brightness: f32, pub style: CursorStyle }
   ```
   Adjust fields to what the current drawing code really reads (check
   `units::draw_fading_unit`, `draw_ranges`, `draw_cursor_and_path`); the
   rule is that a skin needs nothing but the scene, the palette and
   content.
3. **`BattleScreen::scene(&self, ctx: &Ctx) -> MapScene`**: the logic now
   in `draw_terrain`, `draw_ranges`, `draw_units` and
   `draw_cursor_and_path` that decides *what* is shown (which mode shows
   which ranges, when the cursor is hidden, playback's shown units and
   fades), with none of the drawing.
4. **`crates/ui/src/map_view/skin.rs`**:
   ```rust
   pub trait MapSkin {
       fn name(&self) -> &'static str;                 // "glyph"
       /// Visible tiles for a map area of `area` cells.
       fn view_tiles(&self, area: Rect) -> (i32, i32);
       /// Paints `scene` into `area`. Must touch nothing outside it.
       fn paint(&self, ctx: &Ctx, scene: &MapScene, area: Rect, buf: &mut GlyphBuffer);
       /// The console pixel rectangle of `tile`, if visible: where menus and
       /// popups anchor.
       fn tile_px(&self, scene: &MapScene, area: Rect, tile: Pos) -> Option<PxRect>;
   }
   ```
   `Ctx` gains `map_skin: Rc<dyn MapSkin>` (default `GlyphSkin`).
5. **`crates/ui/src/map_view/glyph.rs`, `GlyphSkin`**: move the bodies of
   `draw_terrain`, the tinting in `draw_ranges`, `units.rs`, the drawing
   half of `cursor.rs` and `path::path_overlays` behind `paint`. Keep the
   functions and their unit tests; change their callers, not their output.
   `TILE_W_CELLS`, `path::TILE_PX`, `HP_BAR_W` and the cursor offsets
   become private to the glyph skin.
6. **Camera** (`camera.rs`): `Camera::centred_on` and `follow` take the
   view size in tiles as an argument instead of reading
   `VIEW_TILES_W/H`. `tile_to_cell` stays as the glyph skin's helper;
   the battle screen's menu and popup placement (`draw_menu`,
   `draw_popups`) asks `skin.tile_px` and converts to cells
   (`x / CELL_W_PX`, `y / CELL_H_PX`). Remove `VIEW_TILES_W/H` from
   `layout.rs` or keep them only as the glyph skin's values in its tests.
7. **`BattleScreen::draw`** calls
   `ctx.map_skin.paint(ctx, &self.scene(ctx), MAP_VIEW, buf)` where the
   four map draw calls were. Order relative to menus and panels is
   unchanged.
8. **Text dump**, `MapScene::to_text(&self, content: &Content) -> String`,
   for tests and bug reports: a header (`origin`, `size`), one row of
   terrain string ids per tile row with range marks, then a line per unit
   (`Br enemy brigand (7,3) hp 20/30 acted effect fade=0.25`), the cursor
   and the path. Deterministic; no colours.
9. **Harness** (`crates/ui/src/harness.rs`): `map_scene(&self) ->
   Option<MapScene>` (the battle screen on the stack, through
   `Screen::as_any` or `flow()`), and `map_text()`.
10. If the cinematic player (0817) is already done, make its map shots
    paint through `ctx.map_skin` too and delete its copy of the terrain
    drawing. If it isn't, 0817 says to use the skin.
11. Update `crates/ui/README.md` (a "Map view" section: scene, skin, the
    rule from ADR-0038 that new map things go in the scene).
12. **Landing it.** This moves code that other open battle-screen branches
    touch. Rebase on `main` right before opening the PR, keep moves and
    edits in separate commits, and do nothing else in the PR.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] `git diff --stat` shows no `.snap` file changed.
- [x] `grep -rn "TILE_W_CELLS\|TILE_PX\|VIEW_TILES_" crates/ui/src` finds
      matches only under `crates/ui/src/map_view/glyph*`.
- [x] `BattleScreen` no longer calls `buf.set`, `blend_bg` or
      `add_overlay` for anything inside `MAP_VIEW` except through the
      skin.
- [x] Unit: `scene()` in each mode that shows ranges (selected, threat,
      move-after, targeting, skill target, item target, danger zone on)
      lists the tints the old code drew; the cursor is `None` in the modes
      that hid it.
- [x] Property `glyph_skin_paints_only_the_area`: for any scene and area,
      cells and items outside `area` are untouched.
- [x] Property `scene_units_are_visible`: every `UnitView::pos` lies inside
      `origin..origin + size`.
- [x] Harness test: `map_text()` of the Quick Battle start is pinned as an
      insta snapshot; after `keys` that move the cursor one tile, only the
      cursor line changes.
- [x] All gates in the `run-gates` skill pass.

## Tests required

- Unit: `scene()` per mode; camera with a view size other than 35 × 30;
  `to_text` format.
- Property: the two above.
- Snapshot / integration: the `map_text()` snapshot; every existing battle
  snapshot unchanged.

## Completion notes

**Done (2026-10-01).** The battle screen no longer draws its map. Each
frame `BattleScreen::scene(ctx)` builds a `MapScene` and
`ctx.map_skin.paint(ctx, &scene, MAP_VIEW, buf)` paints it. The only skin
is the `GlyphSkin`, which is the old drawing code, moved. Every existing
snapshot is byte-identical; one snapshot was added (the Quick Battle's
`map_text()`).

Where things are:

- `crates/ui/src/map_view/scene.rs`: `MapScene`, `TileView`, `RangeKind`,
  `UnitView`, `CursorView`, `CursorStyle`, and `MapScene::to_text`.
- `map_view/skin.rs`: the `MapSkin` trait.
- `map_view/glyph.rs` and `map_view/glyph/{units,cursor,path}.rs`: the
  `GlyphSkin`. `TILE_W_CELLS`, `TILE_PX`, `HP_BAR_W` and the cursor's pixel
  offsets are private to it.
- `Ctx::map_skin` (`Rc<dyn MapSkin>`, the glyph skin by default,
  `map_view::default_skin()`).
- `Harness::map_scene()` and `map_text()`; `BattleScreen::scene()`.
- `crates/ui/README.md` has a *Map view* section with the rules.

The PR has two code commits, as the ticket asked: the first only moves
code (imports change, nothing else), the second is the change.

**Deviations from the plan:**

- **`BattleScreen::new(state)` keeps its signature** (it takes no `Ctx`,
  and 78 call sites in tests and other open branches use it). The screen
  holds the view's size in tiles: it starts as the default skin's, and is
  taken from `ctx.map_skin` at the start of every frame; if it changed,
  the camera is re-centred on the cursor. `scene()` is right even before
  the first update (it asks the skin itself). `Camera::centred_on` and
  `follow` take the view size as an argument, as planned.
- **The rewind screen's map goes through the scene too** (`scene()` gives
  the map before the highlighted action when the rewind screen is open).
  The ticket didn't list it, but it drew terrain and units itself.
- **`faction_color` and `hp_fill` stay in `screens/battle/units.rs`.**
  The panels, the forecast, the info screen and the combat box use them,
  and they are about palette names and bar maths, not about tiles. The
  glyph skin imports them; 0433's skin can too.
- **`CursorStyle` moved to `map_view::scene`** (it is part of
  `CursorView`); `screens::battle::cursor::CursorStyle` still works (a
  re-export), so ADR-0024's path is still right.
- **`OVERLAY_BLEND` moved to the glyph skin** (`map_view::glyph`): how
  strongly a range tints a tile is that skin's look.
- **`draw_fading_unit` is gone**: `draw_unit` takes a `UnitView`, which
  carries the fade.
- **`tile_to_cell` takes a `Layout`** (a scene placed in an area) instead
  of a `Camera`: the glyph skin can paint any scene into any area, which
  the `glyph_skin_paints_only_the_area` property needs.
- **`MapSkin::tile_cells`** was added (a provided method: the cells
  `tile_px` touches), so the menu and popup placement don't each convert
  pixels to cells. `menu_origin` now takes the tile's cells, so a skin
  with bigger tiles puts the menu beside the whole tile.
- **`MapScene::cursor` is `None` when the cursor is off the visible
  tiles** (during an AI action's camera pan), not only in the modes that
  hide it: the scene holds what is on the visible map.
- **`to_text`** adds the unit's id (`#4`) and, for a named character, its
  id in brackets, to the ticket's line, and counts equal tiles in a row
  (`plain*3`) so rows stay short.
- The glyph skin cuts a map label longer than two letters to two (labels
  are always two; this only keeps the skin inside its tile for any scene).
- **Existing tests:** three helpers that used `tile_to_cell(pos, camera)`
  or `layout::TILE_W_CELLS` / `VIEW_TILES_W` now use a test helper
  (`testing::tile_cell`), the literal `2`, or the scene's size. Nothing
  else was rewritten (0434 does that).
- Step 10: the cinematic player (0817) isn't done, and its ticket already
  says to use the skin.
- No new ADR: ADR-0038 covers all of this.

**Merged with 0410 (spells), which landed on `main` while this PR was
open.** 0410 drew two new things on the map from the battle screen; per
ADR-0038 they are now in the scene and painted by the glyph skin, with
0410's snapshots byte-identical:

- `TileView::flashes`: a tile whose terrain just changed flashes
  (`TerrainFlash::strength` is now `1` fading to `0`; how strongly that
  tints is the skin's).
- `TileView::becomes`: the terrain the spell being aimed would turn a tile
  into, shown in its place.
- A spell's unit targets are an attack or a heal range, like the others.
- `to_text` marks them: `burnt!` flashes, `plain>burning` would change.

**Merged with 0411 (battle notes) too.** The unit a note is about blinks
(its tile's colours swapped): that is `UnitView::highlight` in the scene,
painted by the glyph skin (`invert_tile` moved there), and the notes box
asks the skin where the noted units' rows are. 0411's snapshots are
byte-identical. `main` did not build its tests at that point (0411 added
`BattleSetup::battle_notes`, and 0505's `crates/bots/src/testkit.rs`,
merged just before, didn't set it); the merge adds that one line.

**A second break on `main`** (11 save tests, 0802, pressing their keys
into the `PLAYER PHASE` banner 0435 added) was fixed on `main` itself by
0810 while this PR was open; this PR carries no change to
`crates/ui/tests/save.rs`.

**Follow-up tickets created:** none. A note was added to 0433 about what
switching skins in the middle of a battle does and doesn't handle yet.

**Gameplay rules decided here:** none. Nothing a player sees changed.

**For Nick:** nothing to try. The game looks and plays exactly as before.

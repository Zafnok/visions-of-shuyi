# 0035 — Decide Harl's combat picture (Chapter 1 boss)

## Context

In 0021 (2026-09-30) Nick chose Mega Tiles' Tiny Tales packs for faces and
combat pictures (`docs/design/look-and-feel.md`, *Portraits and battle art
(bought)*; ADR-0032). The combat scene (0413) shows each fighter's big still
image, moved by the game. Named characters without their own art use their
class's picture, recoloured, and a character's face and combat picture must
match.

**Harl** (`docs/story/characters/red_captain.md`), the Chapter 1 boss, is a
**Brigand**: an enemy-only class that uses **axes only**
(`assets/data/classes.ron`). Weapon types have their own rules
(`docs/design/weapons-and-items.md`: axes always deal at least 5 damage but
hit less often; swords hit harder on follow-ups), so the picture's weapon
must match his. His brief: big, heavy-set, hunched like a bear, a battered
kettle helm, a heavy axe, a red beard, a rusted mail shirt under a red
Company jacket, aged 46.

Nothing in the Mega Tiles catalogue fits. Shown to Nick in 0021 and not
chosen:
- the *Vol.1 Monstrous Uprising* orc axe fighter, as sold and recoloured to
  human skin (Nick: "orc really seems crazy");
- the *Heroes 1* Dragon Knight (ornate dragon armour, a glaive-like pole
  weapon);
- the *Vol.4 Magitek Dynasty* dark knight (a sword, so it would change his
  class).

The *Gods and Gallants* bosses are gods, mechs and monsters. Nick vetoed
commissions ("expensive for just a single asset"). His words: "let's just
have a follow up for this Harl character I can shop around and find more
contenders".

**Changed 2026-10-02 (ticket 0038).** Nick bought the whole Mega Tiles
bundle (37 products) and all of it was checked for Harl:

- No human man carries an axe anywhere in it. The axes belong to orcs,
  nagas, the Heroes 2 **Amazon Warrior** (a woman; she fits Hedda Ravn of
  Chapter 5), the **Warforged** (a golden construct with a halberd), a
  centaur ("Tauromino") and "Water Kaiser Vyrlodhum".
- **Water Kaiser Vyrlodhum** (*Gods and Gallants*) is the closest in
  shape: a big man with a white beard and a huge axe. But he is hooded
  with no visible face, wears a glowing blue spirit wolf, and is twice a
  hero's height. Nick saw him in a combat mockup (spike render G2). Taking
  the wolf off is more than the small edits `look-and-feel.md` allows.
- On the **map**, Harl and his brigands have good human sprites: Human NPC
  Advanced `Warrior_M*` (horned helmets, beards). Only the combat picture
  and the face are missing.
- The Character Generator can make his **face** (full beard, red hair,
  soldier outfit; no kettle helm).

Nick also changed who searches: "I guess you need to help me locate some
more itch bundles to fill in with a similar style for rest of cast".
**Claude now searches** for Harl's picture together with the other gaps
(ticket 0040, which holds the search results and the shortlist); Nick
still decides each purchase. Take Harl's candidates from 0040's shortlist
(*human axe fighter*), render them as below, and record Nick's pick here.

**Answered 2026-10-04 in ticket 0040.** Nick saw Harl's candidates there
with the other gaps and picked **Shironejiya's bearded axe bandit**
(`bandanna05`, free, at 1.25×; `look-and-feel.md`, *Fighters with no Tiny
Tales art*): a big bearded man in a headscarf shouldering a heavy axe. He
keeps his axe, so he stays a Brigand and 0803 is unaffected. **What is left for this ticket:** bring `red_captain.md`'s
portrait brief into line with the picture (a headscarf and a bare-armed
vest, not a kettle helm, mail and a red jacket), then archive it. His face
is still a Character Generator face (0706): the picture has none in our
bust style.

## Nick input

**Decision.** Claude brings candidate packs (0040's shortlist), and Nick
may bring his own. For each, Claude checks and then renders:
- **Licence** against ADR-0032: commercial game OK, modification OK, no
  royalties, not AI output without a human touch.
- **Price:** Nick decides whether it's fine.
- **Style match:** a mockup of the combat scene next to a Tiny Tales hero
  (the lord), from the store preview scaled to our 2× pixel size, plus the
  dialogue screen with his face. Say honestly if the style clashes.
- **Weapon:** an axe keeps him a Brigand. Any other weapon means a class
  change for Harl, which Nick must confirm (it changes the boss fight and
  his character sheet).

Nick picks one, or keeps a stand-in for now.

## Scope

**In:** checking and mocking up the candidates Nick brings, and optionally
a short search by Claude for human axe fighters in a style close to Tiny
Tales. Record the choice in `look-and-feel.md` (*Combat screen*), and in
`red_captain.md` if his look or class changes.

**Out (do not do):** buying anything; commissions; drawing or redrawing
art (only the recolours and small edits `look-and-feel.md` allows);
implementing the combat scene (0413).

## Implementation steps

1. Collect the candidates: 0040's shortlist for a human axe fighter, plus
   any Nick brings (say which are which).
2. For each, record the store, licence text, price, whether it's
   AI-assisted, and the weapon.
3. Render the mockups (as in 0021: the store preview in our frames, in the
   scratchpad, never committed) and send them.
4. Record Nick's pick and his words. If his weapon or class changes, update
   `red_captain.md` and flag 0803 (Chapter 1 units).

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Nick saw a rendered mockup of every candidate and picked one (or
      chose to keep a stand-in).
- [x] `look-and-feel.md` names Harl's picture and its source.
- [x] `cargo xtask ticket-lint` and `typos` pass.

## Tests required

- None (docs only).

## Completion notes

- **The pick was made in ticket 0040** (2026-10-04), where Nick saw
  Harl's candidates in combat mockups beside the lead, with the other
  gaps: Shironejiya's bearded axe bandit (`bandanna05`), free, at 1.25×.
  `look-and-feel.md` (*Combat screen* and *Fighters with no Tiny Tales
  art*) names the picture, its source and its terms. No new mockups were
  made here.
- **He keeps his axe**, so he stays a Brigand; 0803 is unaffected.
- **`red_captain.md`'s portrait brief was rewritten to the picture**: a
  headscarf, a bare-armed vest and trousers, no helm, mail or jacket. The
  Company's red sign moved from a scarf on his arm to the headscarf.
- **Deviation:** one word of the Chapter 1 victory scene changed
  (`ch01.dlg`: Tamsin takes the orders "from inside his vest", it said
  "jacket"), so the script agrees with the picture.
- 0706's note and the roadmap were brought up to date (0035 no longer
  blocks 0413 and 0706).
- **Claude's starting rule (Nick may veto):** as drawn, Harl's headscarf
  is pale grey and his beard dark grey. The brief says both are
  recoloured red (a red headscarf, a rust-red beard going grey), by the
  existing rule that a named character's picture takes their own colours;
  he is "Red" Harl of the Red Company. 0413 and 0706 do the recolour.
- Follow-up tickets: none.

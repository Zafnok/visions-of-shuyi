# 0409 — Shop screen, Visit, Open

## Context

UI for 0308's rules (`docs/design/weapons-and-items.md`, "Money and shops"):
FE on-map Armoury / Vendor / Blacksmith, villages and chests. The same shop
screen is reused between chapters through 0308's `ShopSession`.

**Villages are on hold** (`docs/design/terrain.md`, 2026-09-26: no village
tile yet; ticket 0037 decides it, and 0313 then builds the rules). Build
the village UI only if 0313 is done; this ticket doesn't wait for it.

## Nick input

**Sign-off:** Nick buys, sells and repairs on a test map and comments.

## Scope

**In:** `ShopScreen` (Buy / Sell / Repair tabs by shop kind), `Shop`, `Visit`
and `Open` entries in the action menu, gold in the side panel and shop
header, gift/loot message lines. The shop screen plays the `shop` music cue chosen in
0028 (`docs/design/audio.md`), imported with `assets-src/audio/import.py` and
added to `assets/audio/audio.ron`, `THIRD_PARTY_ASSETS.md` and the credits. On
leaving, the previous track comes back (emit the battle's or scene's cue again).
If 0028 recorded "no music here", skip this.

**Out:** where between-chapter shopping sits in the game flow (0801 for linear chapters; town nodes on the world map, 1007); the Preparations screen's Shop tab with the basic shop (0442, which reuses this ticket's `ShopScreen` lists).

## Implementation steps

1. Action menu: `Shop` on a shop tile, `Visit` on an unvisited village gate,
   `Open` on an unopened chest (player units only).
2. `ShopScreen`: header `ARMOURY    Gold 1 250`; Buy list with price and a
   stat line; Sell list (half price; seals are never listed: no shop buys
   them, `ShopError::NotBought`, ticket 0603); a Blacksmith shows Repair with the cost
   and `12/20 → 20/20`. Unaffordable entries dimmed. Transactions collect into
   one `UnitAction::Shop`; leaving with none sends nothing (unit not done).
3. `Visit` / `Open`: send the action; show `Got 300 gold.` / `Got Potion.`
   (plus the scene hook if a village gift is a scene).
4. The side panel shows party gold.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Harness: buy a Potion on a Vendor tile → gold drops by its price, pack grows, unit done; leaving without buying → unit not done.
- [ ] Harness: repair a damaged weapon at a Blacksmith; visit a village; open a chest.
- [ ] Snapshots below.
- [ ] All gates in the `run-gates` skill pass.

## Tests required

- Harness: flows above.
- Snapshot: Armoury buy tab, Blacksmith repair tab.

# 0803 — Chapter 1 content

## Context

Builds the actual first chapter from `docs/design/chapter-1.md` (0009), the
cast in `docs/story/characters/` (0701), the script (0707) and portraits (0706).
Proves the chapter is winnable with an automated replay.

**Blockers changed 2026-09-29:** 0411 (battle notes) was dropped, since
Chapter 1 has no battle notes (`chapter-1.md`, *Extras*). 0503 (bosses use
Combat Arts and actives) was added, so the boss behaves as designed before the
difficulty sim in step 7 is run and recorded.

**Blockers added 2026-10-01:** 0710 (`@music` in scenes) and 0807 (the
battle file's `music` field). This ticket's scope sets both for Chapter 1,
so both must exist first.

Also 0316 (non-attack skills cost uses per battle; Nick, 2026-10-01: the
playtest waits for it): the winning replay and the difficulty numbers must
be made with the final skill costs.

**Blocker added 2026-10-02:** 0714. The cast is in `characters.ron` as
**speakers** (ids that can talk but aren't units), so the script (0707)
could be checked before this ticket. Step 2 moves the ones who fight into
`characters`.

## Nick input

**Sign-off** happens in the playtest ticket 0804.

## Scope

**In:** `assets/maps/ch01.map`, `assets/chapters/ch01.ron`, real characters
in `characters.ron` (with class/level/stats/loadouts), enemy templates, trigger
wiring, New Game starting at ch01, a winning-replay test, a difficulty sim.
The battle file's `music` cue (0807) and the scenes' `@music` moods (0710),
chosen from the cue list in [`docs/design/audio.md`](../../docs/design/audio.md)
to fit the chapter's beats; ask Nick with the `ask-nick` skill if the beats
don't make it obvious.

**Out:** Chapter 2; balance changes to core formulas (file tickets instead).

## Implementation steps

1. **Map:** design `ch01.map` at the size in `chapter-1.md`, following FE map
   principles: a clear start area, 2–3 lanes/chokepoints, terrain that matters
   (forests for defence, a river with a bridge, a fort), the boss on a
   defensible tile (a fort; `terrain.md` has no gate or throne yet). Sketch it in the PR description.
2. **Roster:** real Chapter 1 characters from the story (replace
   `// PLACEHOLDER` entries; keep test fixtures in `tests/fixtures/` instead of
   shipped data). The five companions and the boss (`retainer`, `sergeant`,
   `poacher`, `keeper`, `heretic`, `red_captain`) are in the file's
   `speakers` list (0714): give each a `characters` entry and take the id
   out of `speakers` (an id in both is an error). Whoever doesn't fight in
   Chapter 1 stays a speaker. Each character's base stats, **talent** stat, starting
   weapon ranks and class records per `progression.md`; generic enemies use
   its generic-unit formula. Classes come from its class tree (which ones is
   `chapter-1.md`'s call: the lord's unique class (0016) + Rider, Archer,
   Cleric, Guard, Mage; tier-3 skills aren't designed yet, ticket 1001).
   Loadouts, starting weapon ranks, the pack cap, default pack and gold per
   `chapter-1.md` and `weapons-and-items.md` (`preparations: false`,
   objective `Rout`, no turn limit, difficulty `Normal`).
3. **Enemies:** count/mix per `chapter-1.md`; AI mix (mostly `Aggressive`, a
   `Guard` group near the boss, boss `Stationary`), sensible loadouts (mix
   weapon kinds so Nick's per-type traits show: a mounted enemy for spears,
   optionally one flyer for bows if the story allows; fliers are tier 3, so
   an early flier is an elite or one of a small number, per the enemy-flier
   rule in `progression.md`, and must stay beatable), one boss with
   a name and portrait. No elementals, reinforcements, villages, chests,
   shops, talk-recruits or battle notes in Chapter 1 (`chapter-1.md`).
4. **Triggers:** wire `ch01_*` scene ids from 0707 (intro, prebattle, boss
   engage, death quotes, victory, tbc; no talk-recruit in Chapter 1). The
   comment at the top of `assets/dialogue/ch01.dlg` lists every id with the
   trigger it is written for: also Hollis's first-turn line, Harl's
   half-HP line, his lines against the lead and against Tamsin, and a
   Casual retreat line next to each companion's Classic death quote. Aske
   counts "twelve men, no, fourteen" in `ch01_prebattle` and the lead may
   answer "Only fourteen?": pick an enemy count that fits.
   Once the companions are in the New Game roster the all-assets test
   checks who may be gone in each scene from these triggers (0715). Then
   delete `chapter_1_never_shows_a_companion_who_may_have_fallen`
   (`crates/content/src/dialogue/tests/presence.rs`, added by 0716): it
   runs the same check on a cast written by hand, and its `certain` map
   says which trigger each scene expects.
5. New Game → `ch01`.
6. **Winning replay test** `crates/ui/tests/it/ch01_winnable.rs` plus a `mod` line in
   `tests/it/main.rs` (or core): a
   hand-authored command list from the chapter seed that wins the map. Keep it
   in a readable `.ron`/text fixture. It must keep passing — if a later balance
   change breaks it, that change must update the replay consciously.
7. **Difficulty sim** (test marked `#[ignore]`, run manually):
   player side controlled by the same AI (Aggressive) over 200 seeds → print
   win rate and average player losses. Record numbers in Completion notes. Target:
   AI-player wins 30–70% (a thinking human should win comfortably; a mindless one
   shouldn't always win). Adjust enemy levels/placement to land in range.

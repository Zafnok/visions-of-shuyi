# 0804 — Chapter 1 playtest

## Context

The first milestone Nick plays. He said he'll judge the game by playing and
will report comments, concerns and bugs. This ticket packages a build, gets
his feedback, and turns it into tickets. **No code changes in this ticket.**

**Blockers added 2026-09-29**, so Nick's first impression includes what's
already designed: Combat Arts in the attack flow (0414), boss arts (0503, via
0803), his uppercase-label request (0417), battle and menu sounds (0424,
0425), scene and battle music (0710, 0807), no freeze when music loads
(0215), victory/defeat/game-over music (0809) and the battle results screen
(0810), without which step 4's question about the rewind EXP bonus can't be
answered because the bonus is never shown.

**Blockers added 2026-10-01** (Nick, asked whether the playtest should wait
for each: "sure", "yes"):

- The combat scene with bought full-body art (0413) and Harl's combat
  picture (0035).
- Non-attack skills cost uses per battle (0316, from Nick's review of
  0503). 0803 waits for it too, so its winning replay and difficulty
  numbers are made with the final skill costs.
- Game Over offers Rewind while charges are left (0822, from Nick's answer
  on ticket 0408; asked whether it should be in before the playtest:
  "yes").

**Blocker added 2026-10-02:** 0714 (dialogue speakers who aren't units).
The Chapter 1 script (0707) can't pass its check without it, and 0803
needs the script.

**Blockers added 2026-10-02 (by 0707):** 0715 and 0716. In Classic a
companion who dies in the battle still talks in the victory scene; 0715
lets a script mark lines by who is still in the army, and 0716 rewrites
the Chapter 1 scenes with it. Nick hasn't been asked whether the playtest
should wait for these; drop them from `blocked_by` if he says no.

**Blocker added 2026-10-02 (ticket 0039):** 0440, sprite units stepping
on the spot and walking along their path. Nick was asked whether the
playtest waits for it and said yes ("B").

**Blockers added 2026-10-02 (ticket 0038):** 0436 and 0437, the battle
map drawn with the bought unit sprites and tilesets. Nick bought the art
that day and, asked whether the playtest waits for the bought-art map,
answered "A" (yes). They bring 0432 and 0433 (the map skin) with them.
Per-map lighting (0438) and the zoom toggle (0439) were not part of the
question and don't block the playtest.

## Nick input

**Sign-off:** play Chapter 1 (≈15–25 min) and report anything: bugs, feel,
difficulty, story, looks, controls.

## Implementation steps

1. Make sure `main` is green and deployed to Pages (0108). Cut `v0.1.0` via
   the release workflow (0107): bump version, merge, tag.
2. Send Nick a short message with:
   - Links: browser build (Pages) and Windows zip (GitHub Release).
   - A key cheat-sheet (from `keymap.ron`, not from memory).
   - What to pay attention to (5 bullets max): cursor feel, readability of the
     map, whether combat numbers make sense, difficulty, whether the story hooks him.
   - "Just tell me in plain words; screenshots welcome."
3. For each piece of feedback, apply the `write-ticket` skill's
   "Turning Nick's playtest feedback into tickets" section. Ask at most one
   clarifying question per unclear item.
4. Ask Nick whether the unused-rewind-charge EXP bonus (7% of a level per
   charge, `death-and-difficulty.md`) felt right, and record any change.
5. Put a summary in Completion notes: feedback verbatim + ticket numbers created.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Nick played and gave feedback.
- [ ] Every feedback item maps to a ticket (or an explicit "won't do" with reason Nick agreed to).
- [ ] `v0.1.0` release exists.

# 1008 — World map skirmishes

## Context

[`docs/design/world-structure.md`](../../docs/design/world-structure.md)
(ticket 0008): chapters on the world map can hold several battles before the
climax. Nick said a chapter may have "many random overworld triggered
skirmishes to train for a climactic battle" (`chapter-1.md`), and in 0008 he
picked a **mix**:

- **Fixed skirmishes:** hand-placed, cleared once. Some guard a path and must
  be won to pass.
- **Random skirmishes:** appear on cleared nodes after story battles. They're
  optional, keep coming, and their enemy level is **capped per act**.

Nick: make sure they're "clearly delineated so that players know which ones
are more important and which ones are just for grinding. Some symbol above
them or a level marker or both." The design uses **both**. The glyphs are
chosen in 1007.

Skirmish battle files use the `music: Pool("skirmish")` field that 0807
adds to battle files (added to `blocked_by` 2026-10-01).

## Nick input

**Sign-off:** Nick plays the test world map, wins a few random skirmishes and
a fixed one, and says whether (1) he can tell at a glance which fights matter,
and (2) the random fights feel like useful training without being grindy.

## Scope

**In:**
- Node kinds `FixedSkirmish` (with a `guards_path` flag) and random skirmish
  groups, drawn with the 1007 symbols and level markers.
- Fixed skirmishes: authored battle data (map, enemies, tier, optional
  scene), cleared once. A guarding one blocks travel past it until it's won.
- Random skirmishes, with all numbers in a data file (*starting values,
  tunable*, from the design): after each story battle is won, **0–2** groups
  spawn on cleared nodes of the current act, with **at most 3** on the map.
  Enemy level cap = latest story battle's level in this act **−1**. Size is
  **4–6 enemies**, the map tier is **Easy**, and rewards are EXP plus
  sometimes a little gold or a common item (never unique items).
- Random skirmish maps: pick from a small pool of authored skirmish maps per
  act, with enemies built from templates at the capped level. (Later, 0510's
  generator can fill this pool with bot-balanced skirmishes; the pool format
  should be plain battle files so it can.) Spawns use the
  campaign's deterministic RNG (0304), so they're saved and reproducible.
- Skirmish music: every skirmish battle file uses `music: Pool("skirmish")`
  (0807; `docs/design/audio.md`: one track at random from the pool).
- The random-skirmish fights are ordinary battles. Death and retreat, rewind
  charges and the unused-charge bonus work as in `death-and-difficulty.md`.
- Test data: two fixed skirmishes (one guarding) and a random pool of two
  maps on the 1007 test world map.

**Out (do not do):**
- Real Act 1 skirmish maps and enemy lists (content tickets after 0701).
- FFT-style random encounters while travelling (Nick didn't pick them).
- The grinding tower (deferred).
- Visions on random skirmishes and stars on fixed ones (decided in 0046 and
  0047; their own implementation tickets build them on top of this one).
- Retuning support thresholds (a tuning ticket after the playtest).

## Implementation steps

1. Read `world-structure.md`, `death-and-difficulty.md`, `supports.md`
   (*Gaining points*, pacing note), the 1007 world-map code and 0304's RNG.
2. `core::worldmap`: add the skirmish node kinds, spawn rules and cleared
   state as commands/events. Spawning happens as an event when a story battle
   is won, and it uses the campaign RNG.
3. Add a data file for the random-skirmish settings (spawn count, cap,
   offset, size, rewards) and the per-act map pool. Validate it with content
   validation.
4. Enemy building for random groups: templates + capped level + default
   loadouts (as in the chapter format).
5. UI: markers and hover info for both kinds (symbol + `Lv N`). A guarded
   path shows as blocked.
6. Tests, then a playtest build for Nick.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Random groups never exceed the act's level cap or 3 on the map (property test).
- [ ] A guarding fixed skirmish blocks travel until it's won; others don't (tests).
- [ ] The same save + same actions spawns the same groups (determinism test).
- [ ] Fixed and random nodes use different symbols and both show a level marker (snapshot).
- [ ] Nick signed off.
- [ ] All gates in the `run-gates` skill pass.

## Tests required

- Unit: spawn rules, level cap, guard blocking, reward rules.
- Property: over random story-battle win sequences, spawn count and levels stay within limits.
- Snapshot: world map with both skirmish kinds and hover info.
- Integration: win a story battle → groups appear → fight one → back on the map with it cleared.

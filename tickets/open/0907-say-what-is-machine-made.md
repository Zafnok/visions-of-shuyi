# 0907 — Say what is machine-made: credits, itch page, Steam's AI survey

## Context

By Nick's direction (`docs/design/voices-languages-and-script.md`) the
game may ship AI-generated voices, machine-translated Japanese and Chinese options,
and a script written by Claude, each to be replaced by paid people later.
Steam requires pre-generated AI content to be described in its content
survey and shows that text on the store page; Japanese players judge
unlabelled machine translation harshly; and Nick credits everyone
(`audio.md` rule 3). ADR-0045 and ADR-0046 record who made each pack and
clip (`made_by`), so the credits can be generated, and change by
themselves when a human replaces something.

## Nick input

**Sign-off** on the wording: the credits lines and the store-page
paragraph are shown to him in the PR description. 0042 (question 3),
0045 (questions 3 and 7: whether anyone checked the Chinese, and how
that is credited) and
0043 (question 6) already fixed the in-game labels; this ticket doesn't
reopen them.

## Scope

**In:** credits screen sections built from data; a store-text file; a
line in 0901 and 0903.

**Out (do not do):** the in-game labels in Options (0825, 0826);
publishing anything (0901, 0903 do that).

Either order with the features: build each section so it shows only when
the build has that thing (a voice manifest with `Generated` clips; a
`Machine` pack). If voices, Japanese or Chinese haven't landed, their section is
simply absent.

## Implementation steps

1. Credits screen (`crates/ui/src/screens/credits.rs`,
   `assets/data/credits.ron`): add sections
   - **Voices:** per cast entry, the character and either "AI-generated
     voice (<tool>)" or the actor's name, from the voice manifest's
     `made_by`.
   - **Translation:** per language pack, "Machine translation" or the
     translator's credit, from `lang.ron`.
   - **Story and script:** the wording Nick signs off (who directed the
     story; that the script was written with an AI model). Put the text
     in `credits.ron`, so a hired writer's name can be added by a data
     edit.
2. `docs/release/store-disclosure.md`: the paragraph for Steam's "AI
   generated content" survey question (pre-generated: voices,
   translation, script; no live generation), and the matching short
   paragraph for the itch page, each listing only what the release
   actually contains. Include the Japanese and Chinese store texts' note that the
   translation is machine-made.
3. 0901 and 0903 already say to use this file (their *Machine-made
   content* paragraphs). If either is done by now, its page needs the
   text: write the exact paste-in steps for Nick in the PR description.
   The file also lists which of Steam's language boxes (Interface /
   Subtitles / Full Audio) to tick for what ships.
4. Text through `ctx.text` (0233) where it has landed.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] With a test manifest holding one `Generated` and one `Recorded` clip, the credits show both correctly (Harness test).
- [ ] With a `Machine` pack the credits say so; with `Human("Name")` they show the name (test).
- [ ] With neither voices nor packs the credits are unchanged (existing snapshot).
- [ ] `store-disclosure.md` exists and 0901 / 0903 point at it.
- [ ] All gates in the `run-gates` skill pass.

## Tests required

- Snapshot / integration: the credits sections.

# Third-party assets

Every non-crate third-party item shipped with the game (fonts, vendored
JavaScript, images, audio, SDK files) must be listed here, per
[ADR-0013](docs/adr/0013-licensing-and-third-party-policy.md). Rust crates are
checked automatically by `cargo-deny` and listed in the generated
`THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.html` in release packages.

Only licenses allowed by ADR-0013 (amended by ADR-0027 and ADR-0032) are
permitted. **Bought art** (ADR-0032) is listed here too, with the seller, the
licence text as quoted on the store page, the date bought, whether it's
AI-assisted, and *private*: its files and licence text live in the private
assets repository (ADR-0040), never in this public repo. For every other
item the license text must be committed next to the item. The music and sounds are
also listed, with tags, in [`assets/audio/audio.ron`](assets/audio/audio.ron);
the game's credits screen (0808) reads them from there.

**Every row needs a credit with the same source link**: a music or sound
credit in `assets/audio/audio.ron`, or an entry in
[`assets/data/credits.ron`](assets/data/credits.ron) for anything else. The
credits screen shows them all, except entries marked `hidden: true`
(software the player never sees). A test in `trpg-content`
(`every_third_party_asset_has_a_credit`) fails when a row has no credit or
a credit has no row.

## Bought art (private): purchase record

Bought art that isn't in a build yet is recorded here as a list. A pack
gets a row in the table below, and a credit, in the ticket that first puts
it in the game (0706, 0413, 0436, 0437).

**A bought pack's row** in *Shipped items* is filled in like this (ADR-0032
§5, ADR-0040):

- *Item*: the pack's name and what of it is in the game, then **(private)**.
- *Source URL*: the pack's store page.
- *Version*: the version in the download's name, and the date bought.
- *License*: `Custom (<seller>)`, the licence text quoted in full from the
  store page or the pack's licence file, and whether the art is AI-assisted.
- *License file*: the path of the licence text **inside the private
  repository**, written as plain text, not a link (it isn't in this one):
  `private: library/tiny-tales/licences/<pack>__License.txt`.
- *Used for*: where the game shows it, and the folder of
  `assets-private/game/` its files are in.

- **Mega Tiles, "2025 Bundle Sale"** (all 37 Mega Tiles products),
  <https://megatiles.itch.io/>. Bought by Nick on **2026-10-02** for
  **$99.99**. *Private*: the files are never in this repository. They are in
  the private repository `Zafnok/visions-of-shuyi-assets` (ADR-0040):
  sorted in `library/tiny-tales/`, the 37 downloads untouched in
  `originals/tiny-tales/`, every pack's licence text and the generator's
  EULA in `library/tiny-tales/licences/`.
  - **Licence**, the same text in every pack's `License.txt`: "You cannot
    claim ownership of the assets (copyright/IP). Assets can be used both
    in free and commercial games. Assets can be modified freely to fit the
    needs of your game. Redistribution and reselling of the asset files or
    derivatives as is without permission is strictly forbidden."
  - **Character Generator EX 1.2** has its own EULA (Mechwolf Productions):
    the pictures it makes "are owned by the End User and may be used for
    personal, commercial, or non-commercial purposes", but may not be
    distributed or sold "as is" outside a larger project, and the program
    itself may not be redistributed.
  - **Credits named in the packs:** produced and published by Megatiles.
    Portraits and static battlers: Rayane Félix, Lunatic Red. Side-view
    battlers and map sprites: Kodots Games Studio. *Wild Beasts* and other
    battler packs: Lunatic Red, Inazuma. *Epic Monsters* and *Gods and
    Gallants*: Aekashics. Generator software: Mechwolf Productions.
  - **AI-assisted:** no (the store pages say no generative AI was used,
    read 2026-09-30).
  - **What we plan to use:** *Heroes: A New Beginning*, *Heroes 2:
    Rebellious Souls* (faces, still battle pictures, map sprites); still
    battler packs Vol.1–5 with their map sprite packs; *Gods and
    Gallants*, *Epic Monsters*; the Human, Knights, Nobility, Orcs, Dark
    Elves and Beastmen map sprite packs and the Mega Sprite Pack; the World
    Map, Overworld, Dungeons 1 and 2 and Tower tilesets; *Battlebacks
    Vol.1*; the Character Generator. Not planned: the Code Ark sci-fi packs
    and UI kit, *Terrains Plus* and the two *Trees* packs (48-pixel tiles
    in another style).

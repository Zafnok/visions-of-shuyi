# Keyboard input: never hard-code a key

Nick (ticket 0030): "never hardcode keyboard input, draw from the config
which can be set by user". Players rebind every key
([`docs/design/controls.md`](../../../docs/design/controls.md), *Rebinding
keys*), so a key written into game code or text is a bug: it stops working
or lies after a rebind, and the two layouts already use different keys.

Background: [ADR-0015](../../../docs/adr/0015-input-actions-and-keymap-layouts.md)
(actions, layouts), [ADR-0031](../../../docs/adr/0031-player-key-bindings.md)
(player bindings, slots, fixed keys, saved config), and
[ADR-0053](../../../docs/adr/0053-player-controller-buttons.md) (the
player's controller buttons in the same saved config).

## The pipeline (only these places know about keys)

```
app/src/keys.rs        macroquad KeyCode → Key / Chord         (only macroquad key code)
assets/data/keymap.ron default chords per action, per layout   (Nick's keys, controls.md)
player config          Storage key `keybindings`               (keys per layout + shared buttons, 3 slots; input/bindings.rs)
ui/src/input.rs        Keymap + InputState: Chord → Action      (fixed Esc = Cancel)
screens                see only `FrameInput.actions` / `is_held(Action)`
screens/key_bindings.rs  the player edits their slots (reads `pressed_chords` / `pressed_buttons` to capture)
widgets/help.rs, tips  Action → key or button name for text     (`ctx.help_keys()`)
```

Files allowed to name `Key::…`, `Chord::…` or key names in strings:
`crates/app/src/keys.rs`, `crates/content/src/keymap.rs`,
`crates/ui/src/input.rs` (and its submodules), test code (`#[cfg(test)]`
items, `tests.rs`, `*_tests.rs`, `tests/`, `crates/ui/src/harness.rs`), and
the keyboard *picture* in `crates/ui/src/screens/layout_picker.rs` (which
keys exist and what each does) and its skin `layout_picker/glyph.rs` (where
each sits): each picture item there sits under a `// check-keys: keyboard
picture` comment (the marker is an error in any other file). Only
`crates/app/src/keys.rs` may use `KeyCode` or macroquad's key reads. Anywhere
else is a bug.

`cargo xtask check-keys` enforces this (CI `tickets` job and `run-gates`).
It scans `crates/{ui,app,content}/src` for key and button types, macroquad key
reads, and string literals naming a key (`"f select"`, `"press f"`,
`"[F]"`, `Space`, `Esc`, `Escape`, `Enter`, `Shift`, `arrows`, `WASD`).
Text in `assets/` (`.ron` strings except `keymap.ron`: tips, item and skill
descriptions; `.dlg` dialogue) is prose, so it only fails on an
instruction to press a key (`press f`, `hold Shift`, `hit Space`), a
`Shift+` chord, `WASD` or `[F]`. Plain words like "Escape!" or "fires
arrows" are fine there. Comments are
not scanned, but doc comments should still name the action, not the key.
Even the layout picker's own keys are data: the `layout_picker` section of
`assets/data/keymap.ron`.

## Controller buttons are keys too

Since ticket 0219 ([ADR-0034](../../../docs/adr/0034-controller-input.md))
a controller is a second source of the same `Action`s, and **every rule
here applies to buttons exactly as to keys**: never match on a `Button`,
never write a button name into game code or text, defaults only in
`keymap.ron`'s `pad` table (Nick's, `controls.md` *Controller → Default
buttons*; a test pins it).

```
app/src/pads.rs, pads/   gilrs / browser Gamepad API → PadState   (only pad reads)
ui/src/input/pad.rs      Pads: PadState → Button down/up          (sticks, Switch swap, merging)
assets/data/keymap.ron   `pad`: default buttons per action; `stick` thresholds
ui/src/input/bindings.rs PadBindings: the player's buttons        (one setup for both layouts; saved under `pad`)
ui/src/input.rs          Keymap + InputState: Button → Action     (same repeat as keys)
ui/src/input/pad.rs      PadKind::button_name: the only table of button names
```

`Button::` may be named only where `Key::` may, plus
`crates/app/src/pads.rs` and `crates/app/src/pads/` (`check-keys` enforces
it). In code and data buttons are named by position (`South`, not "A").
Players rebind them on the Key bindings screen's controller side (ticket
0816, ADR-0053): `PadBindings`, edited like `LayoutBindings` and handed
back with `ctx.set_pad_bindings(…)`; **no button is fixed or reserved**,
so nothing may assume a button keeps its default action, and a screen
that must work with only a controller can't rely on a "safe" button
(the Key bindings screen binds on release and backs out on a hold).
Harness tests press them with
`h.pad("DpadDown South")` / `h.hold_pad("DpadRight", 1.0)`, on the kind of
pad set with `h.use_pad(PadKind::PlayStation)` (a generic one by default).

### Text follows the device pressed last (ticket 0220, ADR-0036)

Help bars, prompts and tips name **keys after a key press and the pad's
buttons after a button press** (`controls.md`, *Switching between keyboard
and controller*), and buttons are named as that pad labels them (`A`, `✕`,
Nintendo's `A` on the right). You get this for free by following rule 2:

- `ctx.help_keys()` is the keymap plus `ctx.device` (`Device::Keyboard` or
  `Device::Pad(kind)`; `Game` keeps it up to date from
  `InputState::device()`). Pass it to `key_name`, `all_key_names`,
  `cursor_keys_name` and `fill_placeholders`. They return the key's name,
  or the button's, or `! not mapped` when the action has none **on that
  device** (an action can have a key and no button).
- Never pass a bare keymap to them (it doesn't compile) and never branch
  on `ctx.device` in a screen to pick a name yourself.
- `HelpKeys::keyboard(&keymap)` only where the text is about the keyboard
  whatever the player holds: the layout picker's key list, the debug hint.
- A button's name comes only from `PadKind::button_name` (D-pad directions
  are `↑ ↓ ← →`; the cursor is `D-pad/L-stick` via `cursor_keys_name`). A new
  name needs its glyphs in the font: `assets/fonts/README.md`, *Our own
  glyphs*; a test checks every name can be drawn.
- Width: button names are longer than keys (`Options`, `D-pad/L-stick`).
  A help line must still fit the row on every pad; test the longest one
  (`the_longest_help_bar_fits_on_every_pad` in `tests/it/controller.rs`).
- Tests that compare a controller run with a keyboard run compare
  `h.snapshot_as(Device::Keyboard)`.

## Rules

1. **React to `Action`s, not keys.** Match on `Action::Confirm`, never on
   `Key::F`. Need a new kind of input? Add an `Action` (below); don't read
   raw keys. The exceptions: the Key bindings screen
   (`screens/key_bindings.rs`, 0815, 0816), which reads
   `FrameInput::pressed_chords()` to capture a key and to see the
   clear-slot key, and `pressed_buttons()` / `released_buttons()` to
   capture a button, and asks `input.rs` helpers (`is_capture_abort`,
   `is_clear_slot`, `capture_abort_key_name`, `clear_slot_key_name`,
   `CAPTURE_PROMPT`, `CAPTURE_BUTTON_PROMPT`) instead of naming keys;
   and **text boxes** (the lead's name, 0801), which ignore actions while
   open, take `FrameInput::text()` (typed characters, from `app`'s
   `RawKeyEvent::Text`) and ask `input::text_key` for their fixed
   Enter / Backspace / Escape, with `input::text_keys_help` as help line.
2. **Name keys in text through the keymap.** Help bars:
   `widgets::help::{key_name, all_key_names, cursor_keys_name, help_line}`,
   given `ctx.help_keys()` (so they name buttons on a controller).
   Tips and other data text: `{ActionName}` / `{Cursor}` placeholders
   (`assets/data/tips.ron`, `crates/ui/src/tips.rs`). Never write `"f"`,
   `"[F]"`, `"Space"`, `"Esc"`, `"arrows"` or `"WASD"` into player text.
   Doc comments name the action ("the End turn key"), not a key.
3. **Expect any key, or none.** Game code can't assume which key an action
   has, that two actions have different keys in both layouts, or (for
   optional actions) that it has a key at all. Text for an
   action with no key shows `NOT_MAPPED` (`! not mapped`), which the help
   helpers do for you.
4. **Default keys are Nick's.** They live only in `assets/data/keymap.ron`
   and must match the table in `docs/design/controls.md`; a test pins it.
   Changing a default is a design change: ask with the `ask-nick` skill,
   then edit both files. Never pick a default key yourself.
5. **Reserved keys**: plain `Esc` is always Cancel and backs out of
   "Press a key…"; plain `Delete` empties a slot. Neither may appear in
   `keymap.ron` or in a player's slots (`Chord::is_reserved`,
   `LayoutBindings::is_reserved`); `Shift+Esc` and `Shift+Delete` are
   ordinary keys. `Keymap::chords_for(Cancel)` leaves
   `Esc` out; `Keymap::fixed_chords_for` names it. The Debug key is not
   rebindable (and reserved in builds with debug tools).
6. **Held and repeated keys** come from `InputState` (repeat timings in
   `keymap.ron`); don't time key presses in a screen.

## Adding an action

1. `crates/content/src/keymap.rs`: add the `Action` variant with a doc
   comment saying what it does, add it to `Action::ALL`, give it a RON name.
2. Is it **required** (must always have a key) or **optional**? That's
   Nick's call: the list is in `controls.md` *Rebinding keys*. If the new
   action isn't covered, ask with `ask-nick`. Set `Action::is_required` to
   match.
3. `assets/data/keymap.ron`: add it to **every** layout (`[]` if it has no
   default key), at most 3 chords (`SLOTS`), keys from `controls.md`.
4. The Key bindings screen: add the action with its player-facing label to
   `ROWS` in `crates/ui/src/screens/key_bindings.rs`, among the required
   or the optional actions (a test checks every rebindable action is
   listed once, required ones first).
5. Screens: react to the action; help bars/tips name it via rule 2.
6. Tests: the keymap-matches-design test, a screen test driven by the
   `Action`, and a Harness test using the default key.

## Tests

- Unit tests of screens: feed `FrameInput`s of `Action`s.
- Harness scripts (`h.keys("Down f")`) may use key names: they pin the
  default right-handed layout on purpose. When a test is about the player's
  own keys, rebind in the test (`h.ctx_mut().set_layout_bindings(…)`
  with an edited `ctx.layout_bindings(layout)`) and press the new key;
  for buttons, `set_pad_bindings(…)` with an edited `ctx.pad_bindings()`.

## Checklist before pushing input work

- [ ] No `Key::`, `Chord::` or `KeyCode` outside the allowed files.
- [ ] No key names in player text or data; placeholders/helpers used.
- [ ] Works in both layouts and with a rebound key or button (test at
      least one).
- [ ] Unbound optional actions don't panic and show `! not mapped`.
- [ ] Text that names a key uses `ctx.help_keys()`, reads right on a pad
      (Harness: `h.pad(…)` then look), and still fits its row.
- [ ] `cargo xtask check-keys` passes.

//! Turn rewind (ticket 0307, `docs/design/death-and-difficulty.md`): a
//! battle's first state and every command applied since, so any earlier
//! point can be rebuilt by replaying.
//!
//! # Rules
//!
//! - **Points.** Point `n` is the battle after its first `n` commands
//!   ([`BattleHistory::state_at`]); point 0 is the state the battle started
//!   in. Rewinding to point `n` undoes command `n` and every one after it,
//!   the enemy's included.
//! - **Charges.** A battle starts with [`BattleState::rewind_charges`]
//!   charges (from the map's difficulty tier, 0801). A rewind costs one
//!   however far back it goes; with none left it is refused. Charges don't
//!   carry between battles, and restarting a battle starts a fresh history
//!   with every charge back.
//! - **Luck is part of the state.** The battle's [`SimRng`](crate::SimRng)
//!   is in [`BattleState`], so replaying rebuilds the exact same state:
//!   **rewinding and then doing the same thing again gives the same
//!   result** (like Echoes' Turnwheel). Doing something different consumes
//!   the RNG differently and so changes what follows naturally.
//! - **Saving.** The history is serialisable for the suspend save (0802).
//!   Like any saved [`BattleState`] (ADR-0020), the first state comes back
//!   without its content tables: the loader must call
//!   [`BattleHistory::restore_tables`] before replaying.

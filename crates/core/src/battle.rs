//! A battle: its state, the [`Command`]s that change it and the [`Event`]s
//! they produce (ADR-0004 rule 2). The UI animates events, the AI issues the
//! same commands as the player, and saves and replays store the state and
//! the commands.
//!
//! # Rules
//!
//! Sources: `docs/design/turn-structure.md` (phases, actions, reinforcements,
//! turn limits) and `docs/design/death-and-difficulty.md` (falling units,
//! loss conditions).
//!
//! - **Phases.** Each turn runs `Player → Enemy → Other` ([`Phase`]; `Other`
//!   is the `Ally` and `Neutral` factions), then `turn += 1`. The battle
//!   starts at turn 1, Player phase. [`Command::EndPhase`] moves to the next
//!   phase that has living units or reinforcements arriving; a phase without
//!   either is skipped (no event). The turn still advances after the Other
//!   phase's slot, whether or not it ran.
//! - **Phase start**, in this order: every unit of the phase becomes ready
//!   (`acted = false`); the phase's reinforcements that are due arrive,
//!   already done ([`Event::UnitsArrived`]); then [`Event::PhaseStarted`]
//!   (before all that, tiles the phase's side set burning burn out, see
//!   *Terrain* below)
//!   (the banner). Units of other phases keep their `acted` flag (drawn
//!   dimmed until their own phase).
//! - **Auto-end is not here.** Ending the player phase when every unit has
//!   acted is a player setting handled by the battle screen, which issues
//!   `EndPhase` itself; AI phases end when the AI issues `EndPhase`.
//! - **Acting.** [`Command::Act`] commits a move and one action together, so
//!   the UI can let the player cancel a move freely before choosing the
//!   action. The unit must be on the map, belong to the current phase, not
//!   have acted, and `dest` must be a tile it can stop on
//!   ([`reachable`]). After the action it is done. No
//!   Canto: a unit never moves after its action (but see *Extending* below).
//! - **Attacking** names a loadout slot. The weapon there must be one the
//!   unit can wield, and the target a hostile unit on the map within its
//!   range *from `dest`*. Attacking equips that weapon ([`Event::Equipped`]
//!   if it changed). The defender counters with its equipped attack (a weapon
//!   it can wield, or an attack spell with uses left), if the attacker is in
//!   range. The combat uses [`forecast`]
//!   and [`resolve`] with the battle's [`SimRng`] and the item table's
//!   [`combat_rules`](ItemTable::combat_rules); each side's stats are
//!   gear-adjusted ([`Unit::combat_input`]); terrain comes from each unit's
//!   tile. Normal attacks cost no durability.
//! - **Spells** ([`UnitAction::Cast`], rules in [`crate::spell`]): the unit
//!   must have learned the spell and have a use left. At battle start every
//!   unit gets full uses (of its spells and its non-attack actives) and, if
//!   it has nothing equipped, its
//!   [default equip](Unit::default_equip) ([`Unit::prepare_for_battle`]).
//!   - An **attack spell** targets a hostile unit in the spell's range from
//!     `dest`, equips the spell ([`Event::Equipped`] if it changed) and fights
//!     exactly like a weapon attack ([`Event::SpellCast`], then
//!     [`Event::CombatResolved`]). Each side that struck with a spell spends 1
//!     use, however many strikes it made ([`Event::SpellUsesChanged`],
//!     attacker first, right after the combat); a defender that fell before
//!     striking spends nothing. Spells give no weapon EXP.
//!   - A **heal spell** targets an ally ([`Faction::is_allied_to`]) other than
//!     the caster, in range from `dest`, below max HP. It restores
//!     `min(heal_power + Mag, max HP − HP)` (gear-adjusted Mag), with no roll
//!     and no counter ([`Event::SpellCast`], [`Event::Healed`],
//!     [`Event::SpellUsesChanged`]).
//!   - A **tile cast** ([`CastTarget::Tile`], `magic.md` "Terrain magic")
//!     needs a spell with a [`terrain_effect`](SpellDef::terrain_effect). The
//!     tile must be on the map, in the spell's range from `dest`, empty (no
//!     unit, the caster at `dest` included) and of a terrain in the effect's
//!     `from`. An attack spell is equipped, as for an attack
//!     ([`Event::Equipped`] if it changed; Nick). The tile becomes `to` at
//!     once ([`Event::SpellCast`], [`Event::TerrainChanged`],
//!     [`Event::SpellUsesChanged`]); no damage, no counter. Casting at a unit
//!     never changes terrain.
//! - **Terrain** lives in the battle's own copy of the map
//!   ([`BattleState::map`]), which movement and combat read, so a changed
//!   tile counts at once. It changes only with an [`Event::TerrainChanged`].
//!   A tile whose effect lasts
//!   [until the caster's next phase](EffectDuration::UntilCastersNextPhase)
//!   (a burning forest) is [`Burning`]: when the caster's side's phase next
//!   comes round, first thing, a unit standing on it takes its `damage`
//!   ([`Event::BurnDamage`]; never below 1 HP, not reduced by Def or Res),
//!   then it becomes its `then` terrain; only then do reinforcements arrive
//!   (Nick). The only unit that can be on a burning tile is a reinforcement
//!   that arrived there. This happens even if that phase is then skipped for
//!   having no units (*Claude's starting rule*: otherwise a fire cast by a
//!   side that was wiped out would burn for ever).
//! - **Weapon EXP.** After a combat, each side still on the map that struck
//!   gains weapon EXP in its weapon's kind ([`Event::WeaponExpGained`], then
//!   [`Event::WeaponRankUp`] if its rank rose; attacker first), before
//!   anyone falls. See [`crate::item`] for the formula; a Combat Art
//!   doubles its user's base.
//! - **Items** ([`UnitAction::UseItem`]): a player unit uses a consumable
//!   from the shared [`BattlePack`]. The target is the unit itself or a non-hostile
//!   unit adjacent to `dest`. The item is used up ([`Event::ItemUsed`]),
//!   heals ([`Event::Healed`], never above max HP) and ends the action.
//!   **Seals can't be used in battle** (Nick, ticket 0603): promotion and
//!   reclass happen between battles ([`crate::progression`]); a seal found
//!   in a chest goes to the stock.
//! - **Shops** ([`UnitAction::Shop`]): a player unit on a shop tile applies
//!   one or more [`ShopTxn`]s in order, with the party's
//!   [`gold`](BattleState::gold) (rules in [`crate::shop`]). An empty list is
//!   refused (leaving a shop without doing anything is not an action).
//!   Bought weapons, armour and accessories go to the unit's free loadout
//!   slot (armour only if its class wears it), else the
//!   [`stock`](BattleState::stock); a bought weapon is equipped if the unit
//!   had none equipped and can wield it. Bought consumables go into the
//!   battle pack, past its cap if need be. Selling the equipped weapon equips
//!   the first other weapon the unit can wield (if any). Each transaction
//!   emits [`Event::Bought`], [`Event::Sold`] or [`Event::Repaired`] (then
//!   [`Event::Equipped`] if that changed), then [`Event::GoldChanged`]. If
//!   any transaction fails, none is applied.
//! - **Chests** ([`UnitAction::Open`]): a player unit on an unopened chest
//!   opens it ([`Event::ChestOpened`]): gold goes to the party (then
//!   [`Event::GoldChanged`]), a consumable into the pack, equipment into the
//!   stock. A chest opens once. Villages are on hold (no village tile,
//!   `docs/design/terrain.md`).
//! - **Skills** ([`crate::skill`] has the skill rules):
//!   - **Passives** of both sides, the **timed effects** on them, and the
//!     **ally auras** of other allied units (green ones too) in reach feed
//!     each combat: [`CombatMods`](crate::combat::CombatMods) and stat
//!     bonuses on its [`CombatantInput`], so the forecast shows them. Stat
//!     bonuses from skills count in combat only and may pass the hard ceilings. "Moved"
//!     conditions count the tiles of the attacker's path; a unit attacked
//!     has moved 0.
//!   - **Combat actives** are an option of an attack
//!     ([`UnitAction::Attack`]'s `active`, paid from the attacking weapon)
//!     or of an attack spell's cast ([`UnitAction::Cast`]'s `active`: spell
//!     actives, paid with 1 extra use). The unit must be able to
//!     [use](Unit::usable_active) it, the attack must suit it
//!     ([`WeaponReq`](crate::skill::WeaponReq)) and the cost must be payable
//!     ([`check_cost`](crate::skill::check_cost)). Events:
//!     [`Event::SkillUsed`], then the payment ([`Event::DurabilitySpent`] or
//!     [`Event::SpellUsesChanged`]), then the combat. Its bonuses count in
//!     this combat; a stance rider counts in it too if its
//!     [`this_combat`](crate::skill::Stance::this_combat) says so (once), and
//!     is then applied ([`Event::EffectApplied`]) if the user still stands; a drain
//!     heals the user after the combat ([`Event::Healed`]). A weapon the
//!     payment brought to 0 breaks after the combat ([`Event::ItemBroke`],
//!     before anyone falls).
//!   - **Other actives** ([`UnitAction::UseSkill`]) spend one of their own
//!     **uses per battle** ([`SkillCost::Uses`](crate::skill::SkillCost::Uses),
//!     [`Event::SkillUsesChanged`]): no weapon is needed and no durability
//!     is spent, and with no use left they are refused
//!     ([`CostError::NoUsesLeft`]). Every unit's uses are filled at battle
//!     start ([`Unit::prepare_for_battle`]). One whose data still costs
//!     durability is paid from the **equipped** weapon (so a unit with a
//!     spell or nothing equipped can't use it). They end the action: a buff
//!     on the user or on the other
//!     allied units in reach of `dest` ([`Event::EffectApplied`] each; none
//!     in reach: refused), a heal of the wounded other allied units in reach
//!     by `Mag + power` + [`heal_bonus`] (none wounded: refused), or
//!     **Shove**. Area actives
//!     never include the user (*Claude's starting rule*).
//!   - **Shove** pushes a hostile unit adjacent to `dest` 1 tile straight
//!     away from it ([`Event::Pushed`]). If that tile is off the map, holds
//!     a unit or can't be entered by the target, the target **stays** and
//!     takes the skill's collision damage (Nick). Pushed into a burning tile
//!     (`magic.md`), it takes the collision damage and lands on the nearest
//!     free tile it can stand on: the first free neighbour of the burning
//!     tile in [`Dir::ALL`](crate::geom::Dir::ALL) order (its own tile is
//!     one, so it never lands further away). A unit it is pushed into takes
//!     the same damage ([`Event::CollisionDamage`]). Collisions can make
//!     either unit fall ([`Event::UnitFell`], pushed unit first; Nick).
//!   - **Moving after an attack** (`turn-structure.md`): after an attack
//!     with a post-action move (Vault, Swoop), if the unit still stands
//!     and has somewhere to go, it is offered the move
//!     ([`Event::MoveAfterOffered`], instead of `UnitActed`) and chooses it
//!     after seeing the combat (Nick): [`Command::MoveAfter`] to a tile within
//!     that many steps through empty tiles it can enter
//!     ([`BattleState::move_after_tiles`]), or to stay. Until then every
//!     other command is refused ([`CommandError::MoveAfterPending`]). The
//!     move ends its action ([`Event::UnitMoved`], [`Event::UnitActed`]).
//!   - **Timed effects** end at the start of their
//!     [`until`](crate::skill::TimedEffect::until) phase, right after its
//!     burn-outs, even if that phase is then skipped
//!     ([`Event::EffectExpired`]).
//!   - **Heal spells** and Sanctuary restore the caster's passives'
//!     [`heal_bonus`] more (White Magic; Nick).
//!   - **Who uses them**: player units, enemy [bosses](crate::unit::Role::Boss) and
//!     green units that aren't [non-combat](crate::unit::Role::Noncombatant) ones; any
//!     other unit is refused actives and arts
//!     ([`CommandError::ArtsNotAllowed`]; `combat-arts.md`).
//! - **Combat Arts** ([`crate::art`] has the art rules;
//!   `docs/design/combat-arts.md`): an option of a weapon attack
//!   ([`UnitAction::Attack`]'s `art`), never of a counter or a cast. An
//!   attack uses one art **or** one combat active
//!   ([`CommandError::ArtWithActive`]). The art must be one of the unit's
//!   [arts for](Unit::arts_for) the attacking weapon, and its cost payable
//!   from that weapon ([`CommandError::CannotPayArt`]: a broken
//!   weapon; with less left than the cost it spends the rest). Events: [`Event::ArtUsed`], the payment
//!   ([`Event::DurabilitySpent`]), a stance ([`Event::EffectApplied`], on
//!   the user until the start of its next phase; it counts in this combat,
//!   once), then the combat, with the art's bonuses on **every** attacker
//!   strike ([`ArtEffect::apply`](crate::art::ArtEffect::apply)). After the
//!   combat's spell uses:
//!   - a **debuff** on the target if one of the attacker's strikes hit and
//!     the target still stands ([`Event::EffectApplied`], until the end of
//!     the target's next phase; the same art refreshes it). Mov and Spd
//!     debuffs feed movement, the danger zone and attack speed;
//!   - **Line Pierce**: if the attacker still stands and the tile one step
//!     past the target, on the straight or diagonal line from `dest`, holds
//!     a unit hostile to it (any other angle has no such tile), one strike at that unit, even if the
//!     target fell: the normal formulas against that unit, no counter, no
//!     extra strikes, rolled after the combat's strikes. It is its own
//!     [`Event::CombatResolved`] (a second combat for unit EXP and class
//!     points, 0601), with numbers worked out when the attack is validated.
//!
//!   Weapon EXP then counts both (one award; the pierce's damage adds to
//!   `dealt`), with the base doubled for the art's user. A weapon the
//!   payment brought to 0 fought unbroken and breaks after
//!   ([`Event::ItemBroke`]), before anyone falls (target, the pierced
//!   unit, then the attacker). [`BattleState::preview_attack`] gives the UI
//!   the forecast, the durability change and the art's
//!   [notes](crate::art::ArtNote) before committing.
//! - **Unit EXP and class points** ([`crate::progression`] has the rules;
//!   `docs/design/progression.md`), for **player units** only, each an
//!   award of EXP ([`Event::ExpGained`], then [`Event::LeveledUp`] and any
//!   [`Event::SpellLearned`]) then class points ([`Event::ClassPointsGained`],
//!   then [`Event::ClassLeveledUp`], [`Event::SpellLearned`],
//!   [`Event::ClassMastered`] and [`Event::SkillLearned`] as they come):
//!   - after an attack, once the fallen are gone: for each combat (a Line
//!     Pierce strike is its own), each side that struck and still stands,
//!     attacker first, gets the combat award (kill, damage or no damage,
//!     against the other unit's character level; a boss kill +40). A
//!     defender that couldn't counter took no part and gets nothing;
//!   - after a heal spell, a tile cast or a non-combat active, the user gets
//!     its award. A non-combat active gives the higher of its own award, a
//!     heal's if it healed (Sanctuary) and a kill's for each hostile unit
//!     it felled (Shove), with the kill's extra CP if it felled one (Nick).
//!
//!   **Ally**-faction units' EXP goes into the battle's
//!   [EXP pool](BattleState::exp_pool) instead. On a **victory**, just before
//!   [`Event::BattleEnded`], the pool is shared: each player unit on the map
//!   below the level cap (fallen units and reinforcements still to come
//!   don't count) gets `pool / their number` EXP, in unit order; the
//!   remainder is lost. On a defeat the pool is lost. Enemies and neutrals
//!   never gain.
//!
//!   **RNG order:** level ups roll on the battle's [`SimRng`] right where
//!   their [`Event::LeveledUp`] is, after the combat's strikes (and Line
//!   Pierce's): 7 [`roll_percent`](crate::rng::RandomSource::roll_percent)
//!   calls each, then a [`roll_below`](crate::rng::RandomSource::roll_below)
//!   per safety-net pick.
//! - **Equipping** ([`Command::Equip`]) is free: any weapon of the loadout
//!   the unit can wield, or any learned attack spell (even one with no uses
//!   left: it just can't counter), by a ready unit of the current phase. It
//!   doesn't end the action. No trading: loadouts are fixed for the battle.
//! - **Falling.** A unit at 0 HP falls ([`Event::UnitFell`]): it leaves the
//!   map, can't act, can't be targeted and doesn't block tiles. It moves to
//!   [`BattleState::fallen`]. Classic vs Casual only matters when the
//!   campaign applies the result (0801).
//! - **Outcome.** Defeat, in both modes, when a player lord falls or no player
//!   unit is left on the map. Victory per [`Objective`]. Both are checked
//!   after every command and when a turn ends; nothing else changes them
//!   (arrivals can't create a victory or a defeat). Loss is checked first.
//!   Once decided ([`Event::BattleEnded`]) every command fails with
//!   [`CommandError::BattleOver`] and the outcome never changes.
//! - **Survive `N`** wins, and a `turn_limit` of `N` loses, when turn `N`'s
//!   last phase ends: the moment `turn` would become `N + 1`.
//! - **Reinforcements** ([`Reinforcement`]) for turn `N` arrive at the start
//!   of their faction's phase on turn `N`, never acting on arrival. One whose
//!   tile is occupied waits and tries again at the same point next turn;
//!   the others of its wave still arrive. Earlier entries go first. A
//!   reinforcement arrives on a burning tile anyway, and takes the fire's
//!   damage when it burns out (Nick).
//! - **Dialogue triggers** ([`Trigger`], ticket 0705,
//!   `docs/design/battle-scenes-and-recruitment.md`): a battle's story
//!   moments. Each names a scene (a script) and a moment ([`TriggerWhen`]),
//!   and plays only the first time if `once` (fired-once state is part of
//!   the battle, so saves, rewinds and replays keep it). The battle inserts
//!   an [`Event::SceneTriggered`] at the moment, in trigger-list order when
//!   several fire together:
//!   - **Turn start**: right after that phase's [`Event::PhaseStarted`]
//!     (the battle's first phase included).
//!   - **Entering an area**: right after an [`Event::UnitMoved`] (an `Act`'s
//!     move or a move after an attack) that ends inside the area, for a
//!     unit that matches. Pushes and arrivals don't count (Nick).
//!   - **Combat start**: right before an [`Event::CombatResolved`], **one
//!     scene at most** (Nick: a fight plays one script, not lines strung
//!     together). If the two fighters' characters have a scene written for
//!     the pair (a trigger `against` the other, either way round), only
//!     that pair's scenes can play, whoever attacks (Nick); else the first
//!     unplayed trigger, in list order, of either fighter. A Line Pierce
//!     strike is a combat too.
//!   - **Half HP**: right after a combat that leaves the character standing
//!     at half its max HP or less (a boss's "halfway" line; not if the
//!     combat felled it).
//!   - **Falling**: right before the character's [`Event::UnitFell`] (a
//!     death quote plays before the unit leaves the map), if the trigger's
//!     `mode` is none or the battle's [`GameMode`] (Classic death quote,
//!     Casual retreat line; `death-and-difficulty.md`). A trigger that
//!     recruits ("joins you if defeated") adds the fallen unit to
//!     [`BattleState::recruited`] ([`Event::UnitRecruited`], right after
//!     the fall): it joins the army after a won battle (0801). Nobody
//!     changes sides in a battle (Nick).
//!   - **Talk** ([`Command::Talk`]): the units of a trigger's two
//!     characters, either one starting it from a tile it can move to next
//!     to the other, while the trigger hasn't fired
//!     ([`BattleState::talk_targets`]). Only [`Event::SceneTriggered`]:
//!     talking is free, like equipping (Nick): the unit doesn't move, stays
//!     ready and still chooses its move and action. Talking never
//!     recruits (Nick).
//! - **Supports** ([`crate::support`] has the support rules;
//!   `docs/design/supports.md`): two **player units** on the map whose
//!   characters are a listed pair gain support points
//!   ([`Event::SupportPoints`], with the points really gained: none while a
//!   conversation waits to be viewed, so no event then):
//!   - when the **player phase ends** with the two adjacent, each pair
//!     once: on [`Command::EndPhase`] (before the next phase starts), or
//!     when an action in the player phase wins the battle (Nick; right
//!     after its [`Event::UnitActed`], before the EXP pool's shares);
//!   - after an **attack**, once the fallen are gone and unit EXP is given:
//!     for each unit that fought and still stands (the attacker, the
//!     target, then a Line Pierce's victim), each partner adjacent to it
//!     (a unit that fell in the fight gains nothing: *Claude's starting
//!     rule*). One attack gives a pair its points once, however many
//!     strikes, and even if both fought (*Claude's starting rule*);
//!   - after a **heal spell**, a healing active (each ally it healed) or a
//!     **buff** active (each other ally it buffed), with the user;
//!   - after an **item** used on a partner (never for using it on itself).
//!
//!   In a combat, each player unit gets the Hit and Avoid of its
//!   **best-ranked** partner within the rules' range of where it stands
//!   (the attacker: its `dest`), attacking or countering; bonuses never
//!   combine. A rank counts once its conversation was viewed (at camp), so
//!   ranks never change during a battle. The support state is part of the
//!   battle ([`BattleState::supports`]), so rewinds and replays keep it;
//!   the campaign takes it back after a victory (0801).
//! - **Errors change nothing.** [`BattleState::apply`] validates the whole
//!   command before touching the state, so on `Err` the state is unchanged.
//!
//! # Extending
//!
//! Every [`Event`] sequence of an `Act` ends with [`Event::UnitActed`] (unless
//! the unit fell, or is offered a move after its attack:
//! [`Event::MoveAfterOffered`], then `UnitActed` comes with the
//! [`Command::MoveAfter`]), optionally followed by [`Event::BattleEnded`]
//! (after the EXP pool's shares, on a victory).
//! Combat Arts pay their costs with [`pay_cost`](crate::skill::pay_cost),
//! as actives do.
//!
//! # Saving
//!
//! `BattleState` is serde-serialisable (RON via `content`/`app`, ADR-0019):
//! the map (with its current terrain), burning tiles, units (with their
//! learned skills, timed effects, role, EXP and class records), fallen units,
//! the EXP pool,
//! pending reinforcements, objective, turn, triggers and which have fired,
//! recruits, the game mode,
//! phase, RNG position, battle pack, gold, stock, opened chests, supports
//! and outcome are all saved (spell uses left live on the units). The
//! **terrain, class, item, spell, skill, art and support tables are not**: they are shared content, held by `Arc` and skipped. A
//! deserialised state has empty tables (every `Act` fails with
//! [`CommandError::UnknownClass`]) until [`BattleState::restore_tables`] is
//! called with the game's tables, as loaded from the same content. The map is
//! saved because it is battle state (terrain magic changes tiles).

//! The campaign: what carries over from one battle to the next (ticket
//! 0801), and the battles it plays.
//!
//! # Rules
//!
//! Sources: `docs/design/death-and-difficulty.md` (falling units, rewind
//! charges and their bonus, game mode), `docs/design/weapons-and-items.md`
//! (the battle pack) and `docs/design/battle-scenes-and-recruitment.md`
//! (recruits join after the battle).
//!
//! - **Roster.** Every character in the army, one [`Unit`] each with its
//!   levels, stats, loadout, weapon ranks and durability. Roster units are
//!   always named characters (the lead, story joins, recruits).
//! - **A battle** ([`BattleDef`], from a battle file) names the tile of each
//!   roster member it deploys ([`PlayerSlot`]). A slot whose character isn't
//!   in the roster (a Classic death) stays empty; a roster member without a
//!   slot stays out of the battle. [`Campaign::battle_setup`] builds the
//!   [`BattleSetup`]: each slot's unit gets the slot's id (slot `i` has id
//!   `i + 1` and the battle file's enemies are numbered after the slots,
//!   [`BattleDef::first_enemy_id`]; a slot the file marks `after_enemies`
//!   is numbered after them instead), the units in id order,
//!   the battle's default pack (empty in a battle with Preparations, where
//!   the player fills it from the stock, [`crate::prep`]), the campaign's
//!   gold, stock and mode, and the rewind charges of the battle's
//!   [`Difficulty`]. The roster members without a slot are the battle's
//!   bench ([`Campaign::bench`]): Preparations may still trade their gear
//!   ([`crate::prep`]), and [`Campaign::set_members`] puts them back.
//! - **After a victory** ([`Campaign::apply_result`]), in this order:
//!   1. Every deployed player unit's roster entry becomes the battle's unit
//!      (levels, EXP, loadout, weapon ranks, durability all carry over). A
//!      fallen one in **Classic** leaves the roster and everything in its
//!      loadout goes to the stock (weapons keep their durability); in
//!      **Casual** it stays, with what it had earned before falling.
//!   2. Every deployed unit still in the roster (standing, or retreated in
//!      Casual) gets the unused-charge bonus: [`UNUSED_CHARGE_PERCENT`]% of
//!      one level's EXP ([`EXP_PER_LEVEL`]) per unused rewind charge, as one
//!      award ([`grant_exp`]: only the level cap limits it; no 100-EXP cap,
//!      Nick), in slot order. Level ups roll on a copy of the battle's RNG,
//!      so the same battle always gives the same result. The
//!      [`BattleRewards`] returned hold those units as they were before the
//!      bonus and what each got, for the results screen (0810).
//!   3. The battle's recruits ([`BattleState::recruited`]) join the roster,
//!      as player units.
//!   4. The stock becomes the battle's (with what was bought or found),
//!      plus the pack's unused items; gold becomes the battle's plus the
//!      battle's `clear_gold`.
//!   5. The supports become the battle's ([`BattleState::supports`]: the
//!      points every battle gives, story battle or skirmish). In
//!      **Classic**, every support of a dead character ends
//!      ([`SupportBook::end_for`]); a **Casual** retreat keeps them.
//!   6. Every roster unit is made ready for the next battle: full HP, not
//!      acted, no timed effects (*Claude's starting rule* for standing
//!      units, as in Fire Emblem; the design says it for Casual retreats).
//!
//!   A defeat changes nothing ([`ApplyError::NotWon`]): the game is over,
//!   and Retry starts the battle again from its setup.
//! - **Supports** (`docs/design/supports.md`, rules in [`crate::support`]):
//!   between battles, [`Campaign::view_support`] views a pair's unlocked
//!   conversation, which is what raises its rank. Both characters must be
//!   in the army, so a dead character's conversations can't be viewed.
//! - **Mode.** Classic → Casual only ([`Campaign::downgrade_mode`]).
//! - **Lead.** [`Campaign::new_game`] gives the lead's unit (character
//!   [`LEAD_ID`]) the player's name, and a map label of that name's first
//!   two letters (*Claude's starting rule*).

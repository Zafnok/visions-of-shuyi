//! Items: weapons, armour, accessories, consumables and seals; a unit's
//! loadout, the shared battle pack, the party stock, weapon ranks and weapon
//! EXP.
//!
//! Source: `docs/design/weapons-and-items.md` (0003). The numbers live in
//! `assets/data/items.ron`, loaded by `trpg-content` into an [`ItemTable`].
//!
//! # Rules
//!
//! - **Loadout** ([`Loadout`]): up to [`WEAPON_SLOTS`] weapons (only the first
//!   `class.weapon_slots` slots may hold one), one armour, one accessory. One
//!   weapon or learned attack spell is *equipped* ([`Equipped`]): it counters,
//!   and a weapon's trait applies. A unit may carry a weapon it can't wield,
//!   but never equip it.
//! - **Default equip** ([`Unit::default_equip`]): the first weapon the unit can
//!   wield, else its first learned attack spell (id order). Used when a battle
//!   starts with nothing equipped, when the equipped weapon is sold, and when
//!   a promotion stows it ([`Unit::fit_weapon_slots`]).
//! - **Fewer weapon slots** ([`Unit::fit_weapon_slots`], called by promotion,
//!   0603): weapons in slots the new class doesn't have go to the party
//!   stock. A 0-slot class (tier-3+ magic) carries no weapons at all.
//! - **Wielding**: the class can use the weapon's kind, and the unit's rank in
//!   that kind is at least the weapon's rank. A unit with no rank recorded in
//!   a kind counts as rank E.
//! - **Gear-adjusted stats** ([`Unit::effective_stats`]): permanent stats plus
//!   the armour and accessory bonuses. Gear may push a stat up but never above
//!   the hard ceiling (a stat already above the ceiling
//!   isn't lowered). Max HP stays the permanent `stats.hp` (no gear gives HP).
//! - **Durability**: normal attacks cost none. [`WeaponInstance::spend_durability`]
//!   (Combat Arts and active skills) lowers it, never below 0. At 0 the weapon is broken:
//!   it still fights with the penalties in [`WeaponRules`].
//! - **Weapon EXP** ([`WeaponRules::weapon_exp`]): after a combat, a unit that
//!   struck gains `base + dealt / 5` in the kind it fought with, where
//!   `base` is 2 if a strike hit, else 1 (doubled with a Combat Art), and
//!   `dealt` is the HP its strikes removed. Its rank rises to the highest
//!   threshold reached, never above the class's max rank. EXP counts from
//!   the current rank's threshold (a unit given rank D by its class starts at
//!   30) and stops at the class's max rank's threshold.
//! - **Battle pack** ([`BattlePack`]): the player side's shared consumables.
//!   The cap limits only what is brought in; items gained in battle go in
//!   anyway.
//! - **Seals** ([`SealDef`], `progression.md`): a tier seal promotes a unit
//!   into a class of its tier, a Reclass Seal changes its class
//!   ([`crate::progression`]). They live in the party [`Stock`] and are only
//!   used **between battles** (Nick, ticket 0603): never from the battle
//!   pack, where a seal is just an item that can't be used. No shop sells or
//!   buys them yet (their prices and sources are chapter and shop data).

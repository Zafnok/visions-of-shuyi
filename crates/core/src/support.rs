//! Supports (ticket 1002): pairs of characters who build points by
//! fighting together, gain ranks by talking at camp, and help each other
//! hit and dodge.
//!
//! # Rules
//!
//! Source: `docs/design/supports.md`. Every number is data
//! ([`SupportRules`], from `assets/data/supports.ron`).
//!
//! - **Pairs.** Only a pair listed in the [`SupportTable`] has a support.
//!   A pair is symmetric ([`SupportPair`]: `(a, b)` is `(b, a)`) and has one
//!   rank track.
//! - **Ranks** are C → B → A ([`SupportRank`]). Points are per pair and
//!   cumulative. Reaching a rank's threshold ([`Thresholds`]; a pair may
//!   override them) **unlocks** its conversation; the rank is **gained when
//!   the conversation is viewed** ([`SupportState::view`]), at camp.
//! - **Points stop at an unlocked, unviewed threshold**: extra points are
//!   lost, so a pair gains at most one rank per camp visit.
//! - **At rank A a pair keeps gaining points**, with nothing to stop at
//!   (Nick: so that saves are ready if ranks past A are ever added).
//! - **Every pair starts at 0 points with every rank locked** (Nick): no
//!   threshold is 0 ([`Thresholds::is_increasing`]).
//! - **Battle bonus** ([`SupportRules::best_bonus`]): Hit and Avoid of the
//!   **single best-ranked** partner in range. Bonuses never combine, so
//!   the most a unit ever gets is the A bonus.
//! - **Death (Classic)**: a dead character's supports end
//!   ([`SupportBook::end_for`]). Their unlocked but unviewed conversations
//!   are removed, they gain no more points, and the ranks already viewed
//!   stay (the "seen" list, [`SupportState::seen`]).
//!
//! The battle gives the points ([`crate::battle`], *Supports*) and the
//! campaign carries the [`SupportBook`] from battle to battle
//! ([`crate::campaign`]).

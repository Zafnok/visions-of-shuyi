//! The battle screen (ADR-0018, `docs/design/look-and-feel.md`): the map
//! viewport on the left, the side panel on the right and the help bar at the
//! bottom. The player browses with the cursor (ticket 0402), selects a unit,
//! steers its path, moves it and picks an action (0403, [`mode`]), and
//! attacks: picks a weapon and a target, reads the [`forecast`] and watches
//! the combat's [`playback`] (0404), or casts a spell on an enemy, an ally
//! or a tile ([`magic`], 0410); a tile whose terrain changes flashes.
//! Around that (0405): the unit
//! [`info`] screen, the danger zone, the [`map_menu`], ending the turn (and
//! auto-end), and the phase and outcome [`banner`]s. Every command sent is
//! kept in a [`BattleHistory`], and Rewind opens the [`rewind`] screen
//! (0307). One-time [`tips`] pop up over it the first time something new
//! happens (0406). The battle's [`notes`] (0411) show in a box at its start
//! and on the map menu's `Objective` page. Scenes the battle's triggers fire (0705) play as a
//! [`DialogueScreen`] overlay over the map, in order with the banners, or
//! inside a combat's playback (a boss's line before the combat, a death
//! quote before the fall). In the Enemy and Other phases the AI acts
//! ([`ai_phase`], 0502): each action is shown one at a time, and the player
//! can only speed it up or skip fights.
//!
//! The map itself isn't drawn here (ADR-0038): the screen says what is on it
//! ([`BattleScreen::scene`]) and the map skin paints that. Panels, menus,
//! boxes and the help bar are this screen's own cells.

//! Combat playback (ticket 0404): after an attack is applied, the battle
//! screen plays its [`Event::CombatResolved`]s strike by strike in a box at
//! the top of the map, then fades out the units that fell
//! ([`Event::UnitFell`]). Everything shown comes from the events; the
//! playback only times them.
//!
//! The timeline is a list of [`Beat`]s laid out when the playback starts:
//! for each combat an intro, then per strike the striker's name flashing,
//! then the result (`HIT -7`, `MISS`, `CRITICAL! -21`) while the target's
//! HP bar drains, with a pause between strikes; then one fall per fallen
//! unit and a short hold. Holding Confirm plays it [`Timings::fast`] times
//! as fast; Cancel skips to the end (ticket 0418, `docs/design/controls.md`).
//!
//! Triggered scenes (0705, [`Event::SceneTriggered`]) are [`Beat::Scene`]s
//! where their events put them: before the combat they come before (a boss
//! engaged), before the fall (a death quote, so the unit is still on the
//! map), or before the outro. The clock stops at a scene until the battle
//! screen [takes](Playback::take_scene) it and plays it; a skip stops there
//! too, then goes on skipping.
//!
//! [`Playback::with_sounds`] places the combat's sound cues (0424) on the
//! timeline: a spell's cast sound as its caster's name starts flashing,
//! each strike's sound as its result shows, a heal's as the outro starts.
//! [`Playback::sounds`] hands out the ones a frame reaches; a skip plays
//! none of those left.

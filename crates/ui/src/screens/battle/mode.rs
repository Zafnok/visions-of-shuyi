//! What the player is doing on the battle screen (ticket 0403), the Fire
//! Emblem move loop: browse ([`Mode::Idle`]), select a unit and steer its
//! path ([`Mode::Selected`]), watch it walk ([`Mode::Moving`]), pick an
//! action ([`Mode::ActionMenu`]); to attack (0404), maybe pick a weapon
//! ([`Mode::WeaponMenu`]), pick a target with the forecast
//! ([`Mode::Targeting`]) and watch the combat ([`Mode::Combat`]); to cast
//! (0410), pick a spell ([`Mode::SpellMenu`]) and what to cast it on
//! ([`Mode::CastTarget`]). The move
//! is only sent, as one
//! [`Command::Act`], when an action is chosen, so cancelling is free: until
//! then the unit's new tile is a drawing override ([`Mode::drawn_pos`]) and
//! the [`BattleState`] is untouched.
//!
//! Pointing the cursor at an enemy the selected unit can attack after moving
//! (0428), with a weapon or an attack spell (0430), aims the path at the
//! tile it will attack from; Confirm walks there and goes straight to the
//! forecast on that enemy with what the unit has equipped, where left and
//! right swap between the weapons and spells that reach it.
//!
//! Around it (0405): the map menu ([`Mode::MapMenu`], [`Mode::UnitList`],
//! [`Mode::Objective`]), the end-turn prompt ([`Mode::EndTurnPrompt`]), the
//! restart and suspend prompts ([`Mode::RestartPrompt`], 0801;
//! [`Mode::SuspendPrompt`], 0802) and
//! the unit info screen ([`Mode::Info`]). Talking (0705): `Talk` in the

//! action menu picks who to talk to ([`Mode::TalkTarget`]); it's free, so
//! the menu opens again after the scene.
//!
//! Transitions are pure ([`step`], [`Mode::tick`]); the screen owns the
//! cursor and applies the [`Effect`]s.

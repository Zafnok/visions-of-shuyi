//! The player's key and button bindings (tickets 0217 and 0816, ADR-0031,
//! ADR-0053): every rebindable action has [`SLOTS`] key slots and [`SLOTS`]
//! controller-button slots. Each layout keeps its own keys
//! ([`LayoutBindings`]); the buttons are one setup shared by both layouts
//! ([`PadBindings`]); the lot is saved as [`PlayerKeys`]. Rules from
//! `docs/design/controls.md`, *Rebinding keys* and *Rebinding buttons*.
//! Pure: [`Ctx`](crate::screen::Ctx) reads and writes the saved text through
//! `Storage`.

//! Invariants: a chord is in at most one slot of a [`LayoutBindings`], and
//! no [reserved](LayoutBindings::is_reserved) chord is in any; a button is

//! Controllers (ticket 0219, ADR-0034): from each connected pad's raw state
//! to the [`Button`] presses and releases [`InputState`] is fed. Pure:
//! `app` fills a [`PadState`] per pad every frame (gilrs on native, the
//! browser's Gamepad API on web) and [`Pads::update`] does the rest, so both
//! platforms share these rules (`docs/design/controls.md`, *Controller*):
//!
//! - **Sticks are 4-way buttons.** A stick pushed far enough counts as one
//!   held direction button, the direction it is pushed furthest, so it
//!   repeats like a held key and never moves diagonally.
//! - **Switch-style pads swap Confirm and Cancel.** Bindings name button
//!   *positions*; on a [`PadKind::Nintendo`] pad the bottom and right face
//!   buttons trade places before the keymap sees them.
//! - **Several pads drive the game as one.** A button held on two pads is
//!   one press, released when the last pad lets go; unplugging a pad
//!   releases what it held.
//!

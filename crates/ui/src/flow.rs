//! The game flow (ticket 0801): from `New Game` through each chapter's
//! scenes and battle to the result; and saving and loading it (0802).
//!
//! ```text
//! New Game → mode → lead → [chapter: intro scenes → (Preparations) → battle
//!     ├─ victory → apply the result → the results (0810: gold, rewind
//!     │            bonus, level ups) → victory scenes
//!     │            → "Save your progress?" (→ slot picker)
//!     │            → next chapter, or "To be continued" → title
//!     ├─ defeat  → Game Over → Retry (the battle again) | Title
//!     └─ Suspend → the suspend save → title]
//! Load Game → slot picker → the chapter after the one the save cleared
//! Continue  → the suspended battle, where it was (the save is deleted)
//! ```
//!
//! [`FlowScreen`] is one screen on the stack that owns the campaign and
//! hosts the flow's screens itself, one at a time ([`Stage`]): it updates
//! and draws the current one, passes on what it pushes (the battle's scene
//! overlays), and when it pops reads its result and moves on. Its
//! [`name`](Screen::name) is the current screen's. A battle is played from
//! its [`BattleSetup`](trpg_core::BattleSetup), kept so that `Restart Battle` (map menu) and
//! `Retry` (Game Over) rebuild it exactly, every rewind charge back.
//!
//! A battle with `preparations: true` opens the Preparations screen (0408)
//! first, which changes the setup's loadouts and pack (and the gear of the
//! roster's units left out of the battle); `Fight!` starts the battle with
//! it. Both restarts go back to Preparations, as the player
//! left it (Nick, 0408), so they can change their gear before trying again.
//! Only the Quick Battle may leave Preparations (back to the title).
//!
//! **Saves** (`death-and-difficulty.md`, ADR-0039). A chapter save holds
//! the campaign once its chapter is won, so its
//! [`chapter`](Campaign::chapter) is the one just cleared until the next
//! begins; loading one starts the chapter after it. The suspend save holds
//! the campaign as the battle started with it and the battle's history;
//! continuing rebuilds the battle's setup from the two, so a restart after
//! it is the same as before.
//!
//! A suspended battle that had Preparations continues with the loadouts,
//! stock and pack it started with (they are in its history), and a restart
//! after it goes back to Preparations as they were left.
//!
//! Music (ticket 0807, `docs/design/audio.md`): each battle file names its
//! music, asked for once each time the battle starts (also on `Retry` and
//! `Restart Battle`, where a pool picks again); it already plays on the
//! battle's Preparations screen. The battle screen asks for
//! none, so the track stays through both phases, combat and rewinds, and
//! on into the victory scenes. Game Over and "To be continued" stop it.

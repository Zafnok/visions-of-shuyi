//! Screens and the screen stack: the UI architecture every screen uses.
//! See `crates/ui/README.md` for how to add a screen.
//!
//! A [`Screen`] reads the frame's [`Action`]s in [`update`](Screen::update)
//! and answers with a [`Transition`]; it paints itself into a
//! [`GlyphBuffer`] in [`draw`](Screen::draw). The [`ScreenStack`] routes
//! input to the top screen only and draws from the top-most opaque screen up,
//! so overlays (menus, dialogs) show the screen below them.

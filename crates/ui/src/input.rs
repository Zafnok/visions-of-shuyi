//! Keyboard and controller input as [`Action`]s (ADR-0006, ADR-0034): a
//! data-driven [`Keymap`] from chords and controller buttons to actions,
//! and [`InputState`], which turns presses and releases plus frame time
//! into the actions screens see, including repeat for held cursor keys and
//! buttons.
//!
//! [`Key`], [`Chord`], [`Button`], [`Action`] and [`Layout`] are defined in
//! `trpg-content` (its keymap loader validates them) and re-exported here.
//! The player's own bindings (3 slots per action, per layout) are in
//! [`bindings`]; [`pad`] turns the controllers' raw state into button
//! presses.
//!
//! **Fixed keys** (`docs/design/controls.md`, *Rebinding keys*; ADR-0031):
//! plain `Escape` is Cancel in every keymap, and `Delete` does nothing in
//! play (the Key bindings screen reads it to empty a slot). Neither can be
//! bound; see [`Chord::is_reserved`]. `Shift+Escape` and `Shift+Delete`
//! are ordinary chords.

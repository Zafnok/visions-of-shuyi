# trpg-ui

Everything between raw key events and the glyphs on screen, with no macroquad,
clock or files (ADR-0004). `app` calls `Game::frame` once per frame and blits
the buffer it returns; tests drive the same `Game` headlessly with the
`Harness`.

| Module | What |
| ------ | ---- |
| `glyph_buffer`, `color`, `snapshot`, `console` | The 100×32 `GlyphBuffer` virtual console (cells, plus rectangles and sprites placed in pixels, and a backdrop behind see-through cells; see *What a frame holds*), palette colours, the text snapshot format |
| `cinema` | `view`: where a backdrop's window starts to look at a point at a zoom, stopping at the scene's edges (ADR-0048) |
| `map_view` | The battle map (ADR-0038): `MapScene` (what is on the visible map, plain data), `MapSkin` (how it looks), the `GlyphSkin` and the `SpriteSkin` (from a tileset file: the whole map, or only the units on glyph terrain, ADR-0049; its ground is each tile's own picture and layers of pictures between tiles, ADR-0052), and what skins share: `Grid` (where tiles go in pixels), `corners` (which tiles a picture between tiles joins) and `path` (the path arrow for any tile size). See *Map view* below |
| `input` | `Action`s, `Layout`, `Keymap`, `InputState` (key repeat) |
| `screen` | `Screen` trait, `Transition`, `FrameInput`, `Ctx` (shared resources, active layout), `ScreenStack` |
| `game` | `Game`: owns the stack, input state, `Ctx`, buffer and music state; `frame(events, dt)` |
| `audio` | `AudioRequest`, the `AudioQueue` screens push to (`ctx.audio`), `MusicState` (which track plays, fades) and its `MusicCommand`s (ADR-0026), `MusicClock` (how far into its track the music is, ADR-0037). Voice clips (ADR-0046) are asked for through `ctx.play_voice(&line_id)`, `ctx.stop_voice()` and `ctx.preload_voices(&line_ids)` |
| `widgets` | `Menu` (vertical list in a box), `help` (help text that names keys, or controller buttons when a pad was pressed last) |
| `flow` | `FlowScreen`: the game flow (ADR-0035). One screen on the stack that owns the `Campaign` and hosts the flow's screens itself: mode, lead, a chapter's scenes, Preparations, its battle, the results of a won battle, Game Over, "To be continued" |
| `screens` | Game screens: `TitleScreen`, `ModeSelectScreen`, `LeadSelectScreen` (with the name grid), `PreparationsScreen` (loadouts and the pack before a battle, 0408), `GameOverScreen`, `ToBeContinuedScreen`, `ResultsScreen` (a won battle's gold, rewind bonus and EXP bars, then its level-up pages, 0810), `LayoutPickerScreen`, `KeyBindingsScreen` (rebinding, 0815), `CreditsScreen` (0808), `DialogueScreen` (full-screen or over the map), `ClassChangeScreen` (`screens/class_change`: promotion and reclass between battles, 0603), `BattleScreen` (`screens/battle`: its `mode` state machine, `attack` targeting, `forecast` panel and combat `playback`, which runs as a mode of the battle screen, ADR-0025) |
| `portrait` | `draw_portrait`: a portrait's PNG as one sprite item at the largest whole scale that fits the 32×16-cell frame, dimmed and/or mirrored (ADR-0043); `fit_whole_scale` for any picture in any frame |
| `debug` | Debug menu (F2 in debug builds): glyph sampler, portrait viewer, test scene (full-screen or overlay), Key bindings (until Options, 0805, opens it), sprite test, class change on a test unit (promote, reclass), scene camera (the test map as a backdrop: pan, zoom 1× to 4×), Map skin (the glyph skin, then every tileset in turn; not saved) |
| `dialogue` | `DialoguePlayer`: plays a dialogue `Scene` one text box at a time and gives the `View` (portraits, speaker, text, caption) to draw |
| `harness` | Headless test driver (tests, or the `harness` feature) |

## What a frame holds

A `GlyphBuffer` is the whole frame. `app` draws it and knows nothing else
about the game (ADR-0003, ADR-0038). It holds three kinds of thing:

| Thing | What | Added with |
| ----- | ---- | ---------- |
| Cells | A glyph with a foreground and a background colour, one per 8×16-pixel cell. All text, boxes and menus | `print`, `fill_rect`, `draw_box`, `set`, … |
| Rectangles (`Overlay`) | A solid colour in a rectangle of console pixels, for what whole cells can't draw (HP bars, the path line, the cursor's corners; ADR-0018) | `add_overlay` |
| Sprites (`Sprite`) | Part of an image file, scaled into a rectangle of console pixels. Every picture (ADR-0038) | `add_sprite` |

Rectangles and sprites are the frame's **items** (`Item`, `buf.items()`;
`overlays()` and `sprites()` give one kind). Both follow the same rules:

- **Layer.** `Layer::Under` items are drawn after the cells' backgrounds
  and before their glyphs; `Layer::Over` items after the glyphs. Within a
  layer, items are drawn in the order they were added, rectangles and
  sprites alike.
- **Clipping.** An item is clipped to the buffer; one wholly outside is
  dropped.
- **Items belong to the cells under them.** `fill_rect` and `blit` replace
  cells, so they remove the parts of items over those cells (a box drawn
  over half a picture hides that half). `blit` brings the source buffer's
  items along, moved with its cells. So draw a panel first, then the items
  on it.
- `dim` and `blend_bg` change cells only.

A sprite:

```rust
let card = ctx.content.images.id("images/test_card.png")?;   // an ImageId
let mut sprite = Sprite::new(
    card,
    Rect::new(0, 0, 16, 16),     // src: the part of the image, in image pixels
    Rect::new(16, 48, 80, 80),   // dest: where, in console pixels (here 5×)
    Layer::Over,
);
sprite.flip_x = true;            // mirrored left to right
sprite.opacity = 128;            // 255 = solid
sprite.paint = Paint::Dimmed;    // or Paint::Solid(colour); Paint::Image by default
buf.add_sprite(sprite);
```

- The image table (`ctx.content.images`, `trpg_content::image`) lists every
  PNG under `assets/` by path, with its size. `ui` never reads pixels; `app`
  decodes the files into textures.
- Clipping and cutting never move or rescale the picture: they only shrink
  the sprite's `clip` (the part of `dest` that is drawn). `src` and `dest`
  stay as given, and a cut sprite becomes up to four sprites with the same
  `src` and `dest`.
- Use whole-number scales (`dest` a multiple of `src`): the nearest image
  pixel is drawn, so other scales look uneven.
- `paint` says how the pixels are coloured (ADR-0049): `Paint::Image`, the
  image's own colours; `Paint::Solid(colour)`, every pixel in one colour
  (the picture's silhouette: a unit's outline is the same frame drawn four
  times, one pixel each way, under the picture); `Paint::Dimmed`, grey and
  darker (`Rgb::dimmed`: a unit that has acted). A pixel is as see-through
  as the image has it, whatever the paint.
- `base` is for a picture that reaches outside the cells it stands on (a
  unit's head over the tile above): give it those cells' pixels, and when
  a menu replaces them the head goes too instead of showing above the
  menu.
- In a snapshot each item is one line under `--- overlays ---`; a sprite's
  is `over  sprite 16,48 80x80  images/test_card.png 0,0 16x16`, followed
  by ` flip`, ` opacity=128`, ` solid=colour` or ` dimmed`, and
  ` clip=x,y wxh` when they apply (`snapshot.rs`).
- The "Sprite test" debug tool shows each of these on the test card; look
  at it after touching how `app` draws items.

### A backdrop: a second picture, panned and zoomed

A frame may also hold one **backdrop** (ADR-0048): another `GlyphBuffer`,
the *scene*, of any size, shown through a window of the console's cells at
a pixel offset and a whole zoom. It is how the cinematic pans over a map.

```rust
// 1. The scene: any buffer. A map skin can paint a whole map into it.
let scene: Rc<GlyphBuffer> = Rc::new(scene);
// 2. Mark the window: cells with no background.
buf.fill_rect(window, Cell::see_through(' ', text));
// 3. Where the window starts in the scene, to look at `centre` at 2×.
let origin = cinema::view(scene_px, window_px, centre, 2);
buf.set_backdrop(Rc::clone(&scene), window, origin, 2);
// 4. Anything drawn now is over the scene.
buf.print_fg(x, y, "Text over the scene", hi);   // glyphs, no box
buf.fill_rect(text_box, Cell::new(' ', text, panel_bg));   // a solid box
```

- The scene shows **only** behind see-through cells
  (`Cell::see_through(glyph, fg)`); every other cell is solid and hides
  it. `print_fg` keeps a cell see-through; `print`, `set`, `fill_rect`,
  `draw_box` and `blit` make it solid.
- `zoom` is a whole number, 1 to 4 (`cinema::MAX_ZOOM`): Nick ruled out
  smooth zoom (`docs/design/title-screen.md`, *Intro cinematic*).
  `origin_px` is in scene pixels and may be a fraction; the renderer
  rounds the scene's place to whole window pixels, so glyphs stay sharp.
- Past the scene's edge the window shows the console's clear colour.
- Clearing the frame removes the backdrop, so set it every frame.
- In a snapshot, see-through cells have their own colour key
  (`bg:see-through`), and the frame ends with
  `--- backdrop: clip x,y wxh  origin x,y  zoom N ---` and the scene's own
  snapshot.
- The "Scene camera" debug tool shows the test map this way; look at it
  after touching how `app` draws a backdrop.

## How a frame runs

1. `app` tells the game what music is sounding
   (`game.set_music_playing(..)`, which sets `ctx.music_clock`), collects
   key and controller-button presses/releases as
   `RawInputEvent`s and calls `game.frame(&events, dt)`. Controllers go
   through `input::Pads` first, which turns each pad's raw state into
   button changes (ADR-0034).
2. `Game` feeds them to `InputState`, which turns them into this frame's
   `Action`s (presses, then repeats of the held cursor key or button). The
   raw key presses also go into `FrameInput::pressed_chords()`, which text
   boxes and the Key bindings screen read (to capture a key for a slot;
   `pressed_buttons` / `released_buttons` are the same for a controller
   button, ADR-0053).
3. Only the **top** screen's `update(ctx, input)` runs. It returns a
   `Transition`: `None`, `Push(screen)`, `Pop`, `Replace(screen)` or `Quit`.
   Popping the last screen also quits.
4. The buffer is cleared and the stack draws: from the top-most screen whose
   `is_overlay()` is `false`, up through every overlay above it.
5. If the screen switched layout (`ctx.choose_layout`), `Game` gives
   `InputState` the new keymap.
6. The audio requests screens pushed to `ctx.audio` are drained; music
   requests go through `MusicState`, which turns them into `MusicCommand`s
   (load, start, gain, stop) and runs the fade.
7. `FrameOutput { buffer, quit, audio, music }` goes back to `app`, which
   plays the sounds and executes the music commands. After a quit, frames
   do nothing.

`Game::start` loads the saved layout from `ctx.storage` (key `layout`); on
first launch there is none, so it opens the layout picker over the title.
Until a layout is picked, `Keymap::layout_picker` is active (`Up`/`w`,
`Down`/`s`, and `f`/`j`/`Enter`/`Space` to pick), so either hand works.

In debug builds `Game` handles the `Debug` action (F2) itself and pushes the
debug menu (unless a debug screen is already on top).

## Map view

The battle map is not drawn by the battle screen (ADR-0038). Each frame:

1. `BattleScreen::scene(ctx)` builds a `MapScene`: the visible tiles (their
   terrain, whether it just changed and flashes, the ranges on them:
   danger, move, attack, heal, and what a spell being aimed would turn
   them into), the terrain of the ring of tiles just outside the view
   (`rim`, read with `terrain_near`; `set_terrain` fills both), the look
   the map's file names (`look`, which the game flow gives the screen),
   the units
   on them (where each is drawn, HP, acted, under a bonus or a penalty, how
   far it has faded, whether it is picked out by a battle note; which way
   it faces, its walking frame and how far it is towards the next tile of
   its walk), the cursor
   (if shown), the selected unit's path, and the animation clock. Plain
   data: no colours, glyphs, cells or pixels.
2. `ctx.map_skin.paint(ctx, &scene, MAP_VIEW, buf)` paints it. The
   `GlyphSkin` (`map_view/glyph`) is coloured letters; the `SpriteSkin`
   (`map_view/sprite`) paints from a tileset (`assets/tilesets/`): the
   whole map if the tileset has terrain tiles, else only the units, over
   the glyph skin's terrain (`sprite/units.rs` paints units either way).
   Its own ground (`sprite/ground.rs`) is each tile's own picture, then
   the tileset's layers in the look the scene names: pictures centred on
   the points where four tiles meet, chosen by which of the four are in
   the layer (`corners.rs`, ADR-0052), and pictures on tiles; then each
   tinted tile's own shape in the tint's colour, over it all.
   The game starts with the skin of the tileset `tiny_tales` when the
   content has it (the bought art, ADR-0040, ADR-0049), else with the
   glyph skin; the debug menu's *Map skin* goes round the glyph skin and
   every tileset (the generated `test`, 24 px tiles; `test_auto`, 16 px
   tiles with layers and an indoor look, shaped like the bought one; and
   `test_units`, unit sheets on glyph terrain).
3. Menus and heal numbers go beside a tile by asking the skin where it is
   (`tile_px` / `tile_cells`).

Rules:

- **The tile size is the skin's.** Nothing outside a skin knows a tile is
  two cells, 16 pixels or 24. The camera gets the view's size in tiles
  from `skin.view_tiles(area)`; when it changes (a skin switched mid-battle)
  the battle screen re-centres its cameras, and an AI action's pan is
  worked out again in the same time.
- **A new thing on the map** (a village, a spell's flash on a tile) is a new
  field of `MapScene`, set in `BattleScreen::scene` and painted by every
  skin. Never draw it into the buffer from the battle screen.
- **How units move is a look** (ticket 0440; timings in
  `screens/battle/walk.rs`), and so is **how fast a walk is shown**:
  `MapSkin::walk_tiles_per_s` (12 under the glyph skin, 6 under a sprite
  skin) and `held_walk_tiles_per_s` (an AI unit's with Confirm held: 48
  and 12). The battle screen takes it each frame and gives it
  to the walk that starts (`Mode::Moving`'s `pace`, an AI action's
  `Pacing`). It changes how long the player watches, never what happens:
  the same tiles, the same step sounds in the same order.
  A unit that can still act steps on the spot
  (`frame`, by the scene's clock); a walking unit's `pos` is the path tile
  it is on, as the rules, the camera and the step sounds have it, and
  `facing`, `frame` and `offset` say how it looks between that tile and
  the next. The sprite skins paint them (a unit whose tileset picture has
  `walk: true`; any other only glides); the glyph skin reads none of them:
  its initials jump from tile to tile.
- **A skin never changes the game**: only the frame and how many tiles are
  on screen. It must paint nothing outside the area it is given.
- **Tests of what happened read the scene** (or the `BattleState`), not
  cells and colours: `screen.scene(&ctx)` in unit tests, `h.map_scene()` /
  `h.map_text()` and the helpers below in Harness tests. Only tests of a
  skin's look read the buffer (see *Writing a Harness test*).
  `h.with_map_skin("sprite")` runs any Harness script under the sprite
  skin (`"sprite_units"`: sprite units on glyph terrain; `"test_auto"`,
  or any tileset's id: that tileset);
  `crates/ui/tests/it/map_skin.rs` plays one under each and checks nothing
  in the game changes.

### Adding a skin

1. A type in `map_view/<name>.rs` implementing `MapSkin`: `view_tiles`
   (how many tiles fit in an area), `paint` and `tile_px` (where a tile
   is, for menus beside it). Work out where tiles go as a `Grid` from your
   tile size, and draw the path with `path::path_overlays(&scene.path,
   &grid, colour)`; share colours and fills with the glyph skin
   (`range_color`, `OVERLAY_BLEND`, `hp_fill`, `ACTED_DIM`, …) rather than
   copying them.
2. Paint nothing outside the area: copy the `…_paints_only_the_area`
   property test.
3. Paint every feature of the scene: copy `every_scene_feature_is_painted`
   (`map_view/sprite.rs`), which lists them all.
4. Give it a name in `map_view::skin_named` so the debug menu and
   `Harness::with_map_skin` can switch to it, and add its name to
   `the_skin_never_changes_the_game`.

### Adding a map feature

1. A field on `MapScene` (or `TileView`, `UnitView`, `CursorView`) that
   says *what* is there, set in `BattleScreen::scene`; add it to
   `MapScene::to_text`.
2. Paint it in **every** skin: `map_view/glyph` and `map_view/sprite`
   (a thing about a unit: `sprite/units.rs`; the sprite skin borrows the
   glyph skin's ground when its tileset has no terrain tiles, so a thing
   on the ground is painted there once for both).
3. The feature list in `sprite.rs`'s `features` lists every field, so it
   won't compile until the new one is there: add a feature for it (a scene
   without and with it), and `every_scene_feature_is_painted` checks the
   frames differ.

A new **terrain** needs no code: give it a tile in every tileset's
`terrain` table (content validation names the ones that lack it), put it
in the layers it belongs to (`assets/tilesets/README.md`), and for the
bought art add it to the mapping `assets-src/tilesets/tiny_tales.ron` and
run `cargo xtask tileset-import`.

`MapScene::to_text(&content)` is the scene as text, for snapshots and bug
reports:

```text
origin (-10,-11) size 35x30
   0: -*10 sea*3 water*2 plain+m*2 forest+da -*17
units 1
  #4 Br enemy brigand (7,3) hp 20/30 acted effect fade=0.25
cursor (3,5) corners 1.00
path (3,5) (4,5)
```

The first line ends with ` look indoor` for a map that names that look.
One line per row of tiles (`-` = off the map, `+` then a letter per range:
`d` danger, `m` move, `a` attack, `h` heal; `!` = flashing after its
terrain changed; `>` then the terrain a spell would turn it into; `*n` =
`n` such tiles in a row), then the units, the cursor and the path.

## Adding a screen

1. Create `src/screens/<name>.rs` (or a sub-module for a big screen) and add it
   to `src/screens/mod.rs`.
2. Implement `Screen`:

   ```rust
   pub struct InfoScreen { menu: Menu }

   impl Screen for InfoScreen {
       fn name(&self) -> &'static str { "info" }   // unique, snake_case

       fn update(&mut self, ctx: &mut Ctx, input: &FrameInput) -> Transition {
           for &action in &input.actions {
               match self.menu.handle(action) {
                   Some(MenuEvent::Chosen(i)) => return Transition::Push(/* … */),
                   Some(MenuEvent::Cancelled) => return Transition::Pop,
                   None => {}
               }
           }
           Transition::None
       }

       fn draw(&self, ctx: &Ctx, buf: &mut GlyphBuffer) {
           // Opaque screens must paint every cell; overlays only their part.
       }

       fn is_overlay(&self) -> bool { false }        // true for menus/dialogs
   }
   ```

3. Rules:
   - React to `Action`s only, never keys. Stop at the first action that
     transitions; the rest of that frame's actions are dropped.
   - Anything animated advances by `input.dt`. Use `input.is_held(action)`
     for hold-to-fast-forward.
   - Colours come from `ctx.palette` (`UiColor` names), never raw RGB.
   - Text that names a key gets it from `widgets::help` (`key_name`,
     `cursor_keys_name`, `help_line`) with `ctx.help_keys()`: each layout
     binds actions to different keys, and after a controller press the same
     calls name that pad's buttons instead (ADR-0036).
   - Text the player reads is never a string literal (ADR-0045). Put it
     in `assets/lang/en/ui.ron` under a `screen.thing` key and ask for it
     with `ctx.text("title.new_game")`, or `ctx.text_with("results.turns",
     &[("count", &n)])` for text with `{count}`-style values in it (which
     also fills `{Confirm}`-style key names, so a help line is one key:
     `"{Cursor} move · {Confirm} select"`). One key per meaning, and one
     key for a whole sentence rather than pieces joined in code: word
     order differs by language. A key the file lacks panics in debug
     builds. Look text up when drawing, or again whenever the screen is
     shown, so it follows `ctx.lang`. `cargo xtask check-text` counts the
     literals left and fails on a new one.
   - Never compute game rules here; send `core` commands and animate events.
   - Shared state that several screens need goes in `Ctx` (a plain struct).
   - Sounds and music: `ctx.audio.play_sound("menu_move")`,
     `play_sound_at(cue, 0.6)`, `play_music("title")`, `stop_music()`. Cue
     ids come from `assets/audio/audio.ron`; an unknown one panics in debug
     builds. Asking for the music already playing does nothing, so a screen
     may ask every time it's shown.
   - Keeping time with the music: read `ctx.music_clock` (`cue`,
     `position` and `length` in seconds; a looped track's position wraps
     at its length). It is `None` until the track really sounds (its file
     loads first, which can take seconds on the web) and stays `None` if
     the file is missing, so never count from your own `play_music` call
     and always handle `None` (ADR-0037).
   - Menu sounds (0425): use `menu.handle_with_sound(action, &mut
     ctx.audio)` for the menu widget (`Menu::without_cancel()` when there
     is nothing to back out of); elsewhere `ctx.audio.menu(MenuSound::…)`
     (`Move`, `Select` for confirming or opening, `Cancel` for backing
     out, `Denied` for confirming what can't be chosen), and `play_sound(CURSOR_MOVE)` per map tile. Play nothing when
     the key does nothing, and nothing for reading on through text.
4. Ship at least one snapshot test and one Harness test (ADR-0007).

## Writing a Harness test

Integration tests live in `crates/ui/tests/it/`, one module per file listed in
`tests/it/main.rs` so they build as one test program, `it` (the crate's
dev-dependency on itself turns on the `harness` feature for them). Unit tests inside the crate
can use `crate::harness::Harness` directly.

```rust
use insta::assert_snapshot;
use trpg_ui::harness::Harness;
use trpg_ui::input::Layout;

#[test]
fn select_opens_new_game() {
    let mut h = Harness::with_layout(Layout::RightHanded); // at the title
    h.keys("f");                         // press + release, one frame each
    assert_eq!(h.top_screen(), "mode_select");
    assert_snapshot!(h.snapshot());      // GlyphBuffer text snapshot
    h.keys("d");
    assert_eq!(h.top_screen(), "title");
}
```

- `keys("Down Down f")`: whitespace-separated chords as written in
  `keymap.ron` (`f`, `Left`, `Shift+Space`, `Enter`, `F2`). Each is pressed
  in one frame and released in the next; frames are `FRAME_DT` (1/60 s).
- `hold("Right", 0.5)`: holds a key for 0.5 simulated seconds (so it
  repeats), then releases it. `wait(0.2)`: time passes with no input. One
  call runs at most `MAX_FRAMES` (2 000, ~33 s); longer ones panic.
- `top_screen()`, `screens()`, `quit_requested()`, `snapshot()`, `game()`.
- `map_scene()`: what the battle on the stack shows on its map, as a
  `MapScene` (`None` with no battle); `map_text()`: the same as text.
  Shortcuts: `cursor_tile()`, `unit_at(pos)`, `tints_at(pos)`, `path()`
  (and on a `MapScene`: `cursor_tile()`, `unit_at(pos)`, `tints_at(pos)`,
  `terrain_at(pos)`). Use these to check what happened on the map (*Map
  view* above).
- `battle()`: the battle screen itself (its `state()`, `cursor()`).
- `with_map_skin("sprite")` / `with_map_skin("glyph")`: paint battle maps
  with that skin from the next frame on.
- **A test that checks what happened reads the scene or the state. Only a
  test of a look reads cells, colours or items, and it lives with the
  skin** (`map_view/glyph*`, `map_view/sprite.rs`). "The lord moved to (5, 5)" is
  `h.unit_at(Pos::new(5, 5))`, not the letters `Lo` at cell (30, 16);
  "(8, 7) is in the brigand's range" is `h.tints_at(..)`, not a cell's
  background. Panel, menu and help-bar text is the same in every skin, so
  reading it from the buffer is fine.
- `flow()` / `flow_mut()`: the game flow on the stack; `flow_mut()` →
  `battle_mut()` → `send(&Command)` plays its battle with scripted
  commands (`crates/ui/tests/it/flow.rs`).
- Audio: `audio_requests()` (every request of the run), `last_frame_audio()`
  (the last frame's; a `keys` press is the frame *before* the last),
  `music_commands()`, `clear_audio()`, `sounds()` (the sound cues played,
  without music). A test of a made-up cue adds it to `ctx.content.audio`
  and builds the Harness with `Harness::from_game`.
- Music clock: the Harness plays the part of `app`. A track sounds from
  the frame after the game starts it and `music_clock()` counts up with
  the frames. `music_load_delay(2.0)` makes tracks take 2 s to load (the
  clock starts that much later); `without_music()` makes none ever sound
  (missing files). Call them before the frames that start the music.
- `Harness::new()` is a first launch (empty storage: the layout picker is on
  top). `Harness::with_layout(layout)` is a later launch with that layout
  saved. `into_storage()` + `Harness::with_storage(..)` restart with the same
  storage. Saves live in it too (`trpg_ui::save`: keys `slot_01`…`slot_30`
  and `suspend`; `crates/ui/tests/it/save.rs`).
- `Harness::with_screen(Box::new(MyScreen::new()))` tests a screen on its
  own, with the right-handed layout.
- Key names in scripts depend on the layout (`docs/design/controls.md`):
  right-handed arrows move, `f` confirms, `d` cancels; left-handed `wasd`
  move, `j` confirms, `k` cancels.

### Seeing a frame

A snapshot is text, so a sprite is one line. To look at a frame, run a
script and render it to a PNG, exactly as `app` draws it (ticket 0232):

```bash
cargo xtask frame-png target/battle.png --keys "Down f Left f" --wait 1.5
```

Steps (`--keys`, `--pad`, `--wait`) run in the order given, from a later
launch with `--layout right|left` (`--web`: as the web build starts).
`--scale` defaults to 2; `--help` has the rest. It is for looking, never a
test: tests read the scene, the state or the snapshot.
- Debug screens are always on in the Harness, so `F2` works in any build.
- Snapshots: read every `.snap.new` before `cargo insta accept`.

# Asset sources

Inputs to the asset tools. Nothing here is embedded in the game; the tools
write their output into `assets/`.

| Path | What | Tool |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `fonts/ter-u16n.bdf` | Terminus Font 4.49.1, 8×16 medium (OFL-1.1, see `assets/fonts/Terminus-LICENSE.txt`), unmodified | `cargo xtask font-atlas` → `assets/fonts/atlas.{png,ron}` |
| `fonts/pad-shapes.bdf` | Our own glyphs added to the atlas: the PlayStation buttons' shapes `✕ ◯ □ △` (ticket 0220, `assets/fonts/README.md`) | the same command, passed after the font |
| `audio/import.py` | Downloads and converts the chosen third-party music and sounds (ticket 0214, ADR-0027; originals git-ignored, see `audio/README.md`) | `python assets-src/audio/import.py` → `music/*.ogg`, `assets/audio/sfx/*.ogg` |
| *(none: made in code)* | The sprite test image, 16×16 (ticket 0231, `assets/images/README.md`) | `cargo xtask test-card` → `assets/images/test_card.png` |
| *(none: made from `terrain.ron`, `classes.ron`, the palette and the font atlas)* | The sprite map skin's test tileset, 24×24 tiles (ticket 0433, `assets/tilesets/README.md`) | `cargo xtask test-tileset` → `assets/tilesets/test.{png,ron}` |
| `audio/sound-audition.html` | The listening page Nick chose the game's sounds on (ticket 0020, `docs/design/audio.md`). Its Web Audio code is the recipe for the sounds we make ourselves: menu move B, select L, cancel B, dodge `miss:quick` (W2), heal HE5 | `cargo xtask sfx` → `assets/audio/sfx/*.wav` (`--check` only verifies the committed files; a test runs it) |

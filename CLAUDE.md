# CLAUDE.md

ASCII-art tactical RPG (Fire Emblem-like, drawn with coloured glyphs like Dwarf
Fortress / Rogue), keyboard-driven with a virtual cursor and vim-style keys.
Rust. Windows exe first, plus web (WASM); itch.io then Steam.

## Who decides what

- **Nick (owner)** decides *game design*: stats, combat, magic, progression,
  story beats, difficulty, look & feel. He does **not** review code and does
  **not** want technical questions. Ask him design questions only via the
  `ask-nick` skill (options drawn from real games + "describe your own").
- **Claude** decides everything technical and records significant choices as
  ADRs in `docs/adr/`.

## Hard rules

1. **Work one ticket at a time** from `tickets/open/`, using the `work-ticket`
   skill. One ticket = one branch = one PR. The PR moves the ticket to
   `tickets/done/`.
2. **No unticketed work.** Don't write game code "to get a head start". Found
   something else to do? Create a ticket (`write-ticket` skill).
3. **Never invent game-design answers.** They come from `docs/design/` (decided
   by `00xx` tickets) and `docs/story/beats.md`. If one is missing, the ticket
   is blocked; say so.
4. **Respect crate boundaries** (ADR-0004): `core` is pure and deterministic
   (no I/O, no clock, no macroquad); state changes only via `Command` → `Event`s;
   only `app` touches macroquad, files, clock, keyboard.
5. **Tests are the review** (ADR-0007). Run the `run-gates` skill before
   pushing. Never weaken a gate to pass it.
6. **Licensing** (ADR-0013): the game is proprietary (see `LICENSE`) and will
   be sold. Only ship dependencies and assets under the permissive licenses
   allowed by ADR-0013: no GPL/LGPL/MPL/copyleft, no non-commercial, nothing that
   costs money. Every non-crate asset goes in `THIRD_PARTY_ASSETS.md`. Never
   change `LICENSE`; that is Nick's call.
7. **Never hard-code a key.** Game code reacts to `Action`s and text names
   keys through the player's keymap; players rebind everything. Follow the
   `keyboard-input` skill whenever input or key names are involved.
8. **Graphics are a skin** (ADR-0038): glyphs today, sprites from image
   files later, and swapping them must stay a small job. `core`, the bots
   and play records know nothing about the look. A picture is a sprite
   item from an asset file, never per-pixel rectangles or cells. Anything
   shown on the battle map goes in the map scene and is painted by the map
   skins, not drawn straight into the buffer. Tests of what happened read
   the scene or the state; only tests of a look read cells and colours.
   Screens follow the same split (ADR-0054): a screen's logic builds a
   view (plain data) and a skin paints it, as `screens/options.rs` does;
   a new screen never decides its look in `draw`.

## Map of the repo

| Path | What |
| ---- | ---- |
| `tickets/` | Backlog. `README.md` explains numbering & lifecycle. `open/` → `done/` |
| `docs/ROADMAP.md` | Milestones and the Chapter 1 critical path |
| `docs/adr/` | Technical decisions (read the index) |
| `LICENSE`, `THIRD_PARTY_ASSETS.md` | Proprietary source-available license; registry of shipped third-party assets |
| `docs/design/` | Nick's game-design decisions (filled by `00xx` tickets) |
| `docs/story/` | Story beats, bible, characters, outline, ledger (ADR-0011) |
| `.claude/skills/` | `work-ticket`, `write-ticket`, `write-adr`, `ask-nick`, `story-writing`, `ascii-art`, `run-gates`, `keyboard-input` |
| `crates/` | `core` (`trpg-core`), `content` (`trpg-content`), `ui` (`trpg-ui`), `app` (`trpg-app`, binary `visions-of-shuyi`), `bots` (`trpg-bots`, playtest bots: dev tooling, never in the game), `xtask` (repo tooling) |
| `assets/` | Everything embedded in the game: `data/`, `fonts/` (later: maps, dialogue, portraits) |
| `assets-src/` | Inputs to asset tools (e.g. the font BDF for `cargo xtask font-atlas`); not embedded |
| `assets-private/` | **Git-ignored**: the checkout of the private repository with the bought art (ADR-0040). `game/` is embedded over `assets/` by the `private-assets` feature; `library/tiny-tales/` is the bought bundle, sorted. `assets-private.rev` (tracked) names the commit to build with |
| `voice/` | **Git-ignored**: voice clips by dialogue line id, shipped beside the game, never embedded (ADR-0046, `docs/voice.md`). Copied from the private repository's `voice/` by `cargo xtask private-assets`. Test clips: `crates/app/tests/voice/` |

## Environment

- Nick's machine: Windows 11, Rust with the **GNU** host toolchain; **no MSVC**.
  Never require MSVC locally. CI builds with MSVC on GitHub runners.
- Local builds need a full MSYS2 mingw-w64 toolchain (`winget install -e --id
  MSYS2.MSYS2` then `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc`): rustup's self-contained
  GNU linker ships without some import libraries (e.g. `imm32`, needed by
  macroquad). `.cargo/config.toml` points the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` linker
  at the MSYS2 install.
- Use `cargo install --locked <tool>` (cargo-binstall fails to build here).
- `cargo xtask clean-merged-targets [--dry-run]` deletes the `target/` build
  folder of every worktree whose PR has merged (10+ GB each).
- **Bought art** (ADR-0040) is never in this repository, and nothing made
  from it (a mockup, a screenshot) is ever committed here.
  `cargo xtask private-assets` checks the private repository out into
  `assets-private/` (only `game/`; add `--library` for the bought packs in
  `assets-private/library/`). Gates never read it. To see it in a build:
  `cargo run -p trpg-app --features private-assets`. After pushing a change
  to it, run `cargo xtask private-assets --pin` and commit
  `assets-private.rev` in the same PR. On Nick's machine the full copy
  (with the character generators and the original zips) is
  `D:\tactical-rpg\assets-private\`.
- Git remote: `https://github.com/Zafnok/visions-of-shuyi` (public).
